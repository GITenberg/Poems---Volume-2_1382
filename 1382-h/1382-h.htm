Mean ends for men who what they are would be:<br />
Penned in their narrow day no change they see<br />
Save one which strikes the blow to brutes and pride.<br />
Our faith is ours and comes not on a tide:<br />
And whether Earth&rsquo;s great offspring, by decree,<br />
Must rot if they abjure rapacity,<br />
Not argument but effort shall decide.<br />
They number many heads in that hard flock:<br />
Trim swordsmen they push forth: yet try thy steel.<br />
Thou, fighting for poor humankind, wilt feel<br />
The strength of Roland in thy wrist to hew<br />
A chasm sheer into the barrier rock,<br />
And bring the army of the faithful through.</p>

We have let the blunderers and the waves<br />

Our lost kinsfellowship to revive.<br />
The battle of the antidote<br />
Is tough, though silent: may you thrive!</p>

Eternal dread of evil days,&mdash;</p>
<h3><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>XX</h3>

Which shows a heart sunk low in the girths:<br />

The misery&rsquo;s there!&nbsp; The shameless one<br />

Herself not yielding what it won:&mdash;</p>

Lost sheared sheep hurt her tender heart<br />
With bleating, stops her ears with wool:&mdash;</p>
<h3>XXVI</h3>

Showers down in lumps a load of alms,<br />
Then pants as one who has lost a breath;</p>
<h3>XXVII</h3>

Too kind to ask a sacrifice<br />
For what it specially doth bestow;&mdash;<br />
Gives <i>she</i>, &rsquo;tis generous, cheese to mice.</p>
<h3>XXVIII</h3>
<p class="poetry">She saw the young Dominion strip<br />
For battle with a grievous wrong,<br />
And curled a noble Norman lip,<br />
And looked with half an eye sidelong;</p>
<h3>XXIX</h3>
<p class="poetry">And in stout Saxon wrote her sneers,<br />
Denounced the waste of blood and coin,<br />
Implored the combatants, with tears,<br />
Never to think they could rejoin.</p>

A headless tyrant built of wealth,<br />
The hypocrite, the belly-God.</p>

Place for true England here is none!</p>

The difference &rsquo;twixt her and him?<br />
My friend, that will you bid them learn.<br />
He shames and binds her, head and limb.</p>

From City riches mainly rise:<br />

<p class="poetry">But these, of all the liveried crew<br />
Obeisant in Mammon&rsquo;s walk,<br />
Most deferent ply the facial screw,<br />
The spinal bend, submissive talk.</p>
<h3>XXXIX</h3>
<p class="poetry">Small fear that they will run to books<br />

To England, and to me my friend.</p>

<h2><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>TIME
AND SENTIMENT</h2>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">see</span> a fair young
couple in a wood,<br />
And as they go, one bends to take a flower,<br />
That so may be embalmed their happy hour,<br />
And in another day, a kindred mood,<br />
Haply together, or in solitude,<br />
Recovered what the teeth of Time devour,<br />
The joy, the bloom, and the illusive power,<br />
Wherewith by their young blood they are endued<br />
To move all enviable, framed in May,<br />
And of an aspect sisterly with Truth:<br />
Yet seek they with Time&rsquo;s laughing things to wed:<br />
Who will be prompted on some pallid day<br />
To lift the hueless flower and show that dead,<br />
Even such, and by this token, is their youth.</p>
<h2><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>LUCIFER IN STARLIGHT</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">On</span> a starred night
Prince Lucifer uprose.<br />
Tired of his dark dominion swung the fiend<br />
Above the rolling ball in cloud part screened,<br />
Where sinners hugged their spectre of repose.<br />
Poor prey to his hot fit of pride were those.<br />
And now upon his western wing he leaned,<br />
Now his huge bulk o&rsquo;er Afric&rsquo;s sands careened,<br />
Now the black planet shadowed Arctic snows.<br />
Soaring through wider zones that pricked his scars<br />
With memory of the old revolt from Awe,<br />
He reached a middle height, and at the stars,<br />
Which are the brain of heaven, he looked, and sank.<br />
Around the ancient track marched, rank on rank,<br />
The army of unalterable law.</p>
<h2>THE STAR SIRIUS</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Bright</span> Sirius! that
when Orion pales<br />
To dotlings under moonlight still art keen<br />
With cheerful fervour of a warrior&rsquo;s mien<br />
Who holds in his great heart the battle-scales:<br />
Unquenched of flame though swift the flood assails,<br />
Reducing many lustrous to the lean:<br />
Be thou my star, and thou in me be seen<br />
To show what source divine is, and prevails.<br />
Long watches through, at one with godly night,<br />
I mark thee planting joy in constant fire;<br />
And thy quick beams, whose jets of life inspire<br />
Life to the spirit, passion for the light,<br />
Dark Earth since first she lost her lord from sight<br />
Has viewed and felt them sweep her as a lyre.</p>
<h2><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>SENSE
AND SPIRIT</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> senses loving
Earth or well or ill<br />
Ravel yet more the riddle of our lot.<br />
The mind is in their trammels, and lights not<br />
By trimming fear-bred tales; nor does the will<br />
To find in nature things which less may chill<br />
An ardour that desires, unknowing what.<br />
Till we conceive her living we go distraught,<br />
At best but circle-windsails of a mill.<br />
Seeing she lives, and of her joy of life<br />
Creatively has given us blood and breath<br />
For endless war and never wound unhealed,<br />
The gloomy Wherefore of our battle-field<br />
Solves in the Spirit, wrought of her through strife<br />
To read her own and trust her down to death.</p>
<h2>EARTH&rsquo;S SECRET</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Not</span> solitarily in
fields we find<br />
Earth&rsquo;s secret open, though one page is there;<br />
Her plainest, such as children spell, and share<br />
With bird and beast; raised letters for the blind.<br />
Not where the troubled passions toss the mind,<br />
In turbid cities, can the key be bare.<br />
It hangs for those who hither thither fare,<br />
Close interthreading nature with our kind.<br />
They, hearing History speak, of what men were,<br />
And have become, are wise.&nbsp; The gain is great<br />
In vision and solidity; it lives.<br />
Yet at a thought of life apart from her,<br />
Solidity and vision lose their state,<br />
For Earth, that gives the milk, the spirit gives.</p>
<h2><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>INTERNAL HARMONY</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Assured</span> of
worthiness we do not dread<br />
Competitors; we rather give them hail<br />
And greeting in the lists where we may fail:<br />
Must, if we bear an aim beyond the head!<br />
My betters are my masters: purely fed<br />
By their sustainment I likewise shall scale<br />
Some rocky steps between the mount and vale;<br />
Meanwhile the mark I have and I will wed.<br />
So that I draw the breath of finer air,<br />
Station is nought, nor footways laurel-strewn,<br />
Nor rivals tightly belted for the race.<br />
Good speed to them!&nbsp; My place is here or there;<br />
My pride is that among them I have place:<br />
And thus I keep this instrument in tune.</p>
<h2>GRACE AND LOVE</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Two</span> flower-enfolding
crystal vases she<br />
I love fills daily, mindful but of one:<br />
And close behind pale morn she, like the sun<br />
Priming our world with light, pours, sweet to see,<br />
Clear water in the cup, and into me<br />
The image of herself: and that being done,<br />
Choice of what blooms round her fair garden run<br />
In climbers or in creepers or the tree<br />
She ranges with unerring fingers fine,<br />
To harmony so vivid that through sight<br />
I hear, I have her heavenliness to fold<br />
Beyond the senses, where such love as mine,<br />
Such grace as hers, should the strange Fates withhold<br />
Their starry more from her and me, unite.</p>
<h2><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>APPRECIATION</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Earth</span> was not Earth
before her sons appeared,<br />
Nor Beauty Beauty ere young Love was born:<br />
And thou when I lay hidden wast as morn<br />
At city-windows, touching eyelids bleared;<br />
To none by her fresh wingedness endeared;<br />
Unwelcome unto revellers outworn.<br />
I the last echoes of Diana&rsquo;s horn<br />
In woodland heard, and saw thee come, and cheered.<br />
No longer wast thou then mere light, fair soul!<br />
And more than simple duty moved thy feet.<br />
New colours rose in thee, from fear, from shame,<br />
From hope, effused: though not less pure a scroll<br />
May men read on the heart I taught to beat:<br />
That change in thee, if not thyself, I claim.</p>
<h2>THE DISCIPLINE OF WISDOM</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Rich</span> labour is the
struggle to be wise,<br />
While we make sure the struggle cannot cease.<br />
Else better were it in some bower of peace<br />
Slothful to swing, contending with the flies.<br />
You point at Wisdom fixed on lofty skies,<br />
As mid barbarian hordes a sculptured Greece:<br />
She falls.&nbsp; To live and shine, she grows her fleece,<br />
Is shorn, and rubs with follies and with lies.<br />
So following her, your hewing may attain<br />
The right to speak unto the mute, and shun<br />
That sly temptation of the illumined brain,<br />
Deliveries oracular, self-spun.<br />
Who sweats not with the flock will seek in vain<br />
To shed the words which are ripe fruit of sun.</p>
<h2><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>THE
STATE OF AGE</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Rub</span> thou thy
battered lamp: nor claim nor beg<br />
Honours from aught about thee.&nbsp; Light the young.<br />
Thy frame is as a dusty mantle hung,<br />
O grey one! pendant on a loosened peg.<br />
Thou art for this our life an ancient egg,<br />
Or a tough bird: thou hast a rudderless tongue,<br />
Turning dead trifles, like the cock of dung,<br />
Which runs, Time&rsquo;s contrast to thy halting leg.<br />
Nature, it is most sure, not thee admires.<br />
But hast thou in thy season set her fires<br />
To burn from Self to Spirit through the lash,<br />
Honoured the sons of Earth shall hold thee high:<br />
Yea, to spread light when thy proud letter I<br />
Drops prone and void as any thoughtless dash.</p>
<h2>PROGRESS</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> Progress you have
little faith, say you:<br />
Men will maintain dear interests, wreak base hates,<br />
By force, and gentle women choose their mates<br />
Most amorously from the gilded fighting crew:<br />
The human heart Bellona&rsquo;s mad halloo<br />
Will ever fire to dicing with the Fates.<br />
&lsquo;Now at this time,&rsquo; says History, &lsquo;those two
States<br />
Stood ready their past wrestling to renew.<br />
They sharpened arms and showed them, like the brutes<br />
Whose haunches quiver.&nbsp; But a yellow blight<br />
Fell on their waxing harvests.&nbsp; They deferred<br />
The bloody settlement of their disputes<br />
Till God should bless them better.&rsquo;&nbsp; They did
right.<br />
And naming Progress, both shall have the word.</p>
<h2><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>THE
WORLD&rsquo;S ADVANCE</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Judge</span> mildly the
tasked world; and disincline<br />
To brand it, for it bears a heavy pack.<br />
You have perchance observed the inebriate&rsquo;s track<br />
At night when he has quitted the inn-sign:<br />
He plays diversions on the homeward line,<br />
Still that way bent albeit his legs are slack:<br />
A hedge may take him, but he turns not back,<br />
Nor turns this burdened world, of curving spine.<br />
&lsquo;Spiral,&rsquo; the memorable Lady terms<br />
Our mind&rsquo;s ascent: our world&rsquo;s advance presents<br />
That figure on a flat; the way of worms.<br />
Cherish the promise of its good intents,<br />
And warn it, not one instinct to efface<br />
Ere Reason ripens for the vacant place.</p>
<h2>A CERTAIN PEOPLE</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">As</span> Puritans they
prominently wax,<br />
And none more kindly gives and takes hard knocks.<br />
Strong psalmic chanting, like to nasal cocks,<br />
They join to thunderings of their hearty thwacks.<br />
But naughtiness, with hoggery, not lacks<br />
When Peace another door in them unlocks,<br />
Where conscience shows the eyeing of an ox<br />
Grown dully apprehensive of an Axe.<br />
Graceless they are when gone to frivolousness,<br />
Fearing the God they flout, the God they glut.<br />
They need their pious exercises less<br />
Than schooling in the Pleasures: fair belief<br />
That these are devilish only to their thief,<br />
Charged with an Axe nigh on the occiput.</p>
<h2><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>THE
GARDEN OF EPICURUS</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">That</span> Garden of
sedate Philosophy<br />
Once flourished, fenced from passion and mishap,<br />
A shining spot upon a shaggy map;<br />
Where mind and body, in fair junction free,<br />
Luted their joyful concord; like the tree<br />
From root to flowering twigs a flowing sap.<br />
Clear Wisdom found in tended Nature&rsquo;s lap<br />
Of gentlemen the happy nursery.<br />
That Garden would on light supremest verge,<br />
Were the long drawing of an equal breath<br />
Healthful for Wisdom&rsquo;s head, her heart, her aims.<br />
Our world which for its Babels wants a scourge,<br />
And for its wilds a husbandman, acclaims<br />
The crucifix that came of Nazareth.</p>
<h2>A LATER ALEXANDRIAN</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">An</span> inspiration
caught from dubious hues<br />
Filled him, and mystic wrynesses he chased;<br />
For they lead farther than the single-faced,<br />
Wave subtler promise when desire pursues.<br />
The moon of cloud discoloured was his Muse,<br />
His pipe the reed of the old moaning waste.<br />
Love was to him with anguish fast enlaced,<br />
And Beauty where she walked blood-shot the dews.<br />
Men railed at such a singer; women thrilled<br />
Responsively: he sang not Nature&rsquo;s own<br />
Divinest, but his lyric had a tone,<br />
As &rsquo;twere a forest-echo of her voice:<br />
What barrenly they yearn for seemed distilled<br />
From what they dread, who do through tears rejoice.</p>

ORSON OF THE MUSE</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Her</span> son, albeit the
Muse&rsquo;s livery<br />
And measured courtly paces rouse his taunts,<br />
Naked and hairy in his savage haunts,<br />
To Nature only will he bend the knee;<br />
Spouting the founts of her distillery<br />
Like rough rock-sources; and his woes and wants<br />
Being Nature&rsquo;s, civil limitation daunts<br />
His utterance never; the nymphs blush, not he.<br />
Him, when he blows of Earth, and Man, and Fate,<br />
The Muse will hearken to with graver ear<br />
Than many of her train can waken: him<br />
Would fain have taught what fruitful things and dear<br />
Must sink beneath the tidewaves, of their weight,<br />
If in no vessel built for sea they swim.</p>
<h2>THE POINT OF TASTE</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Unhappy</span> poets of a
sunken prime!<br />
You to reviewers are as ball to bat.<br />
They shadow you with Homer, knock you flat<br />
With Shakespeare: bludgeons brainingly sublime<br />
On you the excommunicates of Rhyme,<br />
Because you sing not in the living Fat.<br />
The wiry whizz of an intrusive gnat<br />
Is verse that shuns their self-producing time.<br />
Sound them their clocks, with loud alarum trump,<br />
Or watches ticking temporal at their fobs,<br />
You win their pleased attention.&nbsp; But, bright God<br />
O&rsquo; the lyre, what bully-drawlers they applaud!<br />
Rather for us a tavern-catch, and bump<br />
Chorus where Lumpkin with his Giles hobnobs.</p>

An author and maternal?&mdash;in this trap<br />
(To quote you) of poor hollow folk who rap<br />
On instruments as like as drum to drum.<br />
You snarled tut-tut for welcome to tum-tum,<br />
So like the nose fly-teased in its noon&rsquo;s nap.<br />
You scratched an insect-slaughtering thunder-clap<br />
With that between the fingers and the thumb.<br />
It seemeth mad to quit the Olympian couch,<br />
Which bade our public gobble or reject.<br />
O spectacle of Peter, shrewdly pecked,<br />
Piper, by his own pepper from his pouch!<br />

To roll ingurgitation till he slept,<br />
Rations exchanged with flavour for the adept:<br />
And merrily plied him captain, mate and crew.<br />
At last this dancer to the Polar star<br />
Sank, washed out within, and overboard was pitched,<br />
To drink the sea and pilot him to land.<br />
O captain-critic! printed, neatly stitched,<br />

Not eggs, but the drowned soul of Hildebrand.</p>

THEME</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Of</span> me and of my
theme think what thou wilt:<br />
The song of gladness one straight bolt can check.<br />
But I have never stood at Fortune&rsquo;s beck:<br />
Were she and her light crew to run atilt<br />
At my poor holding little would be spilt;<br />
Small were the praise for singing o&rsquo;er that wreck.<br />
Who courts her dooms to strife his bended neck;<br />
He grasps a blade, not always by the hilt.<br />
Nathless she strikes at random, can be fell<br />
With other than those votaries she deals<br />
The black or brilliant from her thunder-rift.<br />
I say but that this love of Earth reveals<br />
A soul beside our own to quicken, quell,<br />
Irradiate, and through ruinous floods uplift.</p>

wisdom that my mind exacts<br />
Through contemplation from a heart unbent<br />

The summer flies it mightily attracts.<br />
Yet they seem choicer than your sons of facts,<br />
Which scarce give breathing of the sty&rsquo;s content<br />
For their diurnal carnal nourishment:<br />
Which treat with Nature in official pacts.<br />
The deader body Nature could proclaim.<br />
Much life have neither.&nbsp; Let the heavens of wrath<br />
Rattle, then both scud scattering to froth.<br />
But during calms the flies of idle aim<br />
Less put the spirit out, less baffle thirst<br />
For light than swinish grunters, blest or curst.</p>

DANGER OF WAR</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Avert</span>, High Wisdom,
never vainly wooed,<br />
This threat of War, that shows a land brain-sick.<br />
When nations gain the pitch where rhetoric<br />
Seems reason they are ripe for cannon&rsquo;s food.<br />
Dark looms the issue though the cause be good,<br />
But with the doubt &rsquo;tis our old devil&rsquo;s trick.<br />
O now the down-slope of the lunatic<br />
Illumine lest we redden of that brood.<br />
For not since man in his first view of thee<br />
Ascended to the heavens giving sign<br />
Within him of deep sky and sounded sea,<br />
Did he unforfeiting thy laws transgress;<br />
In peril of his blood his ears incline<br />
To drums whose loudness is their emptiness.</p>

A tongue that loathsomeness will not affright<br />
From speaking to the soul of us forthright<br />
What things our craven senses keep from ken.<br />
This is the doing of the Christ; the way<br />
He went on earth; the service above guile<br />

Cries to the Mammonites: Allay, allay<br />

Brings vengeance down; nor them who rouse revile.</p>

<h3><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>V</h3>
<p class="poetry">The dog was of novel breed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shannon retriever, untried:<br />
His master, an old Irish lord,<br />
In an oaken armchair snored<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At midnight, whisky beside.</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p class="poetry">Perched up a desolate tower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the black storm-wind was a whip<br />
To set it nigh spinning, these two<br />
Were alone, like the last of a crew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Outworn in a wave-beaten ship.</p>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p class="poetry">The dog lifted muzzle, and sniffed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He quitted his couch on the rug,<br />
Nose to floor, nose aloft; whined, barked;<br />
And, finding the signals unmarked,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Caught a hand in a death-grapple tug.</p>
<h3>VIII</h3>
<p class="poetry">He pulled till his master jumped<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For fury of wrath, and laid on<br />
With the length of a tough knotted staff,<br />
Fit to drive the life flying like chaff,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And leave a sheer carcase anon.</p>
<h3>IX</h3>
<p class="poetry">That done, he sat, panted, and cursed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The vile cross of this brute: nevermore<br />
Would he house it to rear such a cur!<br />
The dog dragged his legs, pained to stir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eyed his master, dropped, barked at the door.</p>
<h3><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>X</h3>
<p class="poetry">Then his master raised head too, and
sniffed:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It struck him the dog had a sense<br />
That honoured both dam and sire.<br />
You have guessed how the tower was afire.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shannon retriever dates thence.</p>
<h3>XI</h3>
<p class="poetry">I mused: saw the pup ease his heart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of his instinct for chasing, and sink<br />
Overwrought by excitement so new:<br />
A scene that for Koby to view<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the seizure of nerves in a link.</p>
<h3>XII</h3>
<p class="poetry">And part sympathetic, and part<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Imitatively, raged my poor brute;<br />
And I, not thinking of ill,<br />
Doing eviller: nerves are still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our savage too quick at the root.</p>
<h3>XIII</h3>
<p class="poetry">They spring us: I proved it, albeit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I played executioner then<br />
For discipline, justice, the like.<br />
Yon stick I had handy to strike<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should have warned of the tyrant in men.</p>

As the oak in bracken-stem.<br />
And, &rsquo;tis said, how each and each:<br />
Which commences, which subsides:<br />
First my Dragon! doth beseech<br />
Her who food for all provides.<br />

BALLAD OF PAST MERIDIAN</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Last</span> night returning
from my twilight walk<br />
I met the grey mist Death, whose eyeless brow<br />
Was bent on me, and from his hand of chalk<br />
He reached me flowers as from a withered bough:<br />
O Death, what bitter nosegays givest thou!</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p class="poetry">Death said, I gather, and pursued his way.<br
/>
Another stood by me, a shape in stone,<br />
Sword-hacked and iron-stained, with breasts of clay,<br />
And metal veins that sometimes fiery shone:<br />
O Life, how naked and how hard when known!</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p class="poetry">Life said, As thou hast carved me, such am
I.<br />
Then memory, like the nightjar on the pine,<br />
And sightless hope, a woodlark in night sky,<br />
Joined notes of Death and Life till night&rsquo;s decline<br />
Of Death, of Life, those inwound notes are mine.</p>

DAY OF THE DAUGHTER OF HADES</h3>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">He</span> who has looked
upon Earth<br />
Deeper than flower and fruit,<br />
Losing some hue of his mirth,<br />
As the tree striking rock at the root,<br />
Unto him shall the marvellous tale<br />
Of Callistes more humanly come<br />
With the touch on his breast than a hail<br />
From the markets that hum.</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p class="poetry">Now the youth footed swift to the dawn.<br />
&rsquo;Twas the season when wintertide,<br />
In the higher rock-hollows updrawn,<br />
Leaves meadows to bud, and he spied,<br />
By light throwing shallow shade,<br />
Between the beam and the gloom,<br />
Sicilian Enna, whose Maid<br />
Such aspect wears in her bloom<br />
Underneath since the Charioteer<br />
Of Darkness whirled her away,<br />
On a reaped afternoon of the year,<br />
Nigh the poppy-droop of Day.<br />
O and naked of her, all dust,<br />
The majestic Mother and Nurse,<br />
Ringing cries to the God, the Just,<br />
Curled the land with the blight of her curse:<br />
Recollected of this glad isle<br />
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>Still
quaking.&nbsp; But now more fair,<br />
And momently fraying the while<br />
The veil of the shadows there,<br />
Soft Enna that prostrate grief<br />
Sang through, and revealed round the vines,<br />
Bronze-orange, the crisp young leaf,<br />
The wheat-blades tripping in lines,<br />
A hue unillumined by sun<br />
Of the flowers flooding grass as from founts:<br />
All the penetrable dun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the morn ere she mounts.</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p class="poetry">Nor had saffron and sapphire and red<br />
Waved aloft to their sisters below,<br />
When gaped by the rock-channel head<br />
Of the lake, black, a cave at one blow,<br />
Reverberant over the plain:<br />
A sound oft fearfully swung<br />
For the coming of wrathful rain:<br />
And forth, like the dragon-tongue<br />
Of a fire beaten flat by the gale,<br />
But more as the smoke to behold,<br />
A chariot burst.&nbsp; Then a wail<br />
Quivered high of the love that would fold<br />
Bliss immeasurable, bigger than heart,<br />
Though a God&rsquo;s: and the wheels were stayed,<br />
And the team of the chariot swart<br />
Reared in marble, the six, dismayed,<br />
Like hoofs that by night plashing sea<br />
Curve and ramp from the vast swan-wave:<br />
For, lo, the Great Mother, She!<br />
And Callistes gazed, he gave<br />
His eyeballs up to the sight:<br />
The embrace of the Twain, of whom<br />
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>To men are
their day, their night,<br />
Mellow fruits and the shearing tomb:<br />
Our Lady of the Sheaves<br />
And the Lily of Hades, the Sweet<br />
Of Enna: he saw through leaves<br />
The Mother and Daughter meet.<br />
They stood by the chariot-wheel,<br />
Embraced, very tall, most like<br />
Fellow poplars, wind-taken, that reel<br />
Down their shivering columns and strike<br />
Head to head, crossing throats: and apart,<br />
For the feast of the look, they drew,<br />
Which Darkness no longer could thwart;<br />
And they broke together anew,<br />
Exulting to tears, flower and bud.<br />
But the mate of the Rayless was grave:<br />
She smiled like Sleep on its flood,<br />
That washes of all we crave:<br />
Like the trance of eyes awake<br />
And the spirit enshrouded, she cast<br />
The wan underworld on the lake.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They were so, and they passed.</p>
<h4>IV</h4>
<p class="poetry">He tells it, who knew the law<br />
Upon mortals: he stood alive<br />
Declaring that this he saw:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He could see, and survive.</p>
<h4>V</h4>
<p class="poetry">Now the youth was not ware of the beams<br />
With the grasses intertwined,<br />
For each thing seen, as in dreams,<br />
Came stepping to rear through his mind,<br />
Till it struck his remembered prayer<br />
<a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>To be
witness of this which had flown<br />
Like a smoke melted thinner than air,<br />
That the vacancy doth disown.<br />
And viewing a maiden, he thought<br />
It might now be morn, and afar<br />
Within him the memory wrought<br />
Of a something that slipped from the car<br />
When those, the august, moved by:<br />
Perchance a scarf, and perchance<br />
This maiden.&nbsp; She did not fly,<br />
Nor started at his advance:<br />
She looked, as when infinite thirst<br />
Pants pausing to bless the springs,<br />
Refreshed, unsated.&nbsp; Then first<br />
He trembled with awe of the things<br />
He had seen; and he did transfer,<br />
Divining and doubting in turn,<br />
His reverence unto her;<br />
Nor asked what he crouched to learn:<br />
The whence of her, whither, and why<br />
Her presence there, and her name,<br />
Her parentage: under which sky<br />
Her birth, and how hither she came,<br />
So young, a virgin, alone,<br />
Unfriended, having no fear,<br />
As Oreads have; no moan,<br />
Like the lost upon earth; no tear;<br />
Not a sign of the torch in the blood,<br />
Though her stature had reached the height<br />
When mantles a tender rud<br />
In maids that of youths have sight,<br />
If maids of our seed they be:<br />
For he said: A glad vision art thou!<br />
And she answered him: Thou to me!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As men utter a vow.</p>

<p class="poetry">Then said she, quick as the cries<br />
Of the rainy cranes: Light! light!<br />
And Helios rose in her eyes,<br />
That were full as the dew-balls bright,<br />
Relucent to him as dews<br />
Unshaded.&nbsp; Breathing, she sent<br />
Her voice to the God of the Muse,<br />
And along the vale it went,<br />
Strange to hear: not thin, not shrill:<br />
Sweet, but no young maid&rsquo;s throat:<br />
The echo beyond the hill<br />
Ran falling on half the note:<br />
And under the shaken ground<br />
Where the Hundred-headed groans<br />
By the roots of great Aetna bound,<br />
As of him were hollow tones<br />
Of wondering roared: a tale<br />
Repeated to sunless halls.<br />
But now off the face of the vale<br />
Shadows fled in a breath, and the walls<br />
Of the lake&rsquo;s rock-head were gold,<br />
And the breast of the lake, that swell<br />
Of the crestless long wave rolled<br />
To shore-bubble, pebble and shell.<br />
A morning of radiant lids<br />
O&rsquo;er the dance of the earth opened wide:<br />
The bees chose their flowers, the snub kids<br />
Upon hindlegs went sportive, or plied,<br />
Nosing, hard at the dugs to be filled:<br />
There was milk, honey, music to make:<br />
Up their branches the little birds billed:<br />
Chirrup, drone, bleat and buzz ringed the lake.<br />
O shining in sunlight, chief<br />
After water and water&rsquo;s caress,<br />
<a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Was the
young bronze-orange leaf,<br />
That clung to the tree as a tress,<br />
Shooting lucid tendrils to wed<br />
With the vine-hook tree or pole,<br />
Like Arachne launched out on her thread.<br />
Then the maiden her dusky stole<br />
In the span of the black-starred zone,<br />
Gathered up for her footing fleet.<br />
As one that had toil of her own<br />
She followed the lines of wheat<br />
Tripping straight through the fields, green blades,<br />
To the groves of olive grey,<br />
Downy-grey, golden-tinged: and to glades<br />
Where the pear-blossom thickens the spray<br />
In a night, like the snow-packed storm:<br />
Pear, apple, almond, plum:<br />
Not wintry now: pushing, warm!<br />
And she touched them with finger and thumb,<br />
As the vine-hook closes: she smiled,<br />
Recounting again and again,<br />
Corn, wine, fruit, oil! like a child,<br />
With the meaning known to men.<br />
For hours in the track of the plough<br />
And the pruning-knife she stepped,<br />
And of how the seed works, and of how<br />
Yields the soil, she seemed adept.<br />
Then she murmured that name of the dearth,<br />
The Beneficent, Hers, who bade<br />
Our husbandmen sow for the birth<br />
Of the grain making earth full glad.<br />
She murmured that Other&rsquo;s: the dirge<br />
Of life-light: for whose dark lap<br />
Our locks are clipped on the verge<br />
Of the realm where runs no sap.<br />
She said: We have looked on both!<br />
<a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>And her
eyes had a wavering beam<br />
Of various lights, like the froth<br />
Of the storm-swollen ravine stream<br />
In flame of the bolt.&nbsp; What links<br />
Were these which had made him her friend?<br />
He eyed her, as one who drinks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And would drink to the end.</p>
<h4>VII</h4>
<p class="poetry">Now the meadows with crocus besprent,<br />
And the asphodel woodsides she left,<br />
And the lake-slopes, the ravishing scent<br />
Of narcissus, dark-sweet, for the cleft<br />
That tutors the torrent-brook,<br />
Delaying its forceful spleen<br />
With many a wind and crook<br />
Through rock to the broad ravine.<br />
By the hyacinth-bells in the brakes,<br />
And the shade-loved white windflower, half hid,<br />
And the sun-loving lizards and snakes<br />
On the cleft&rsquo;s barren ledges, that slid<br />
Out of sight, smooth as waterdrops, all,<br />
At a snap of twig or bark<br />
In the track of the foreign foot-fall,<br />
She climbed to the pineforest dark,<br />
Overbrowing an emerald chine<br />
Of the grass-billows.&nbsp; Thence, as a wreath,<br />
Running poplar and cypress to pine,<br />
The lake-banks are seen, and beneath,<br />
Vineyard, village, groves, rivers, towers, farms,<br />
The citadel watching the bay,<br />
The bay with the town in its arms,<br />
The town shining white as the spray<br />
Of the sapphire sea-wave on the rock,<br />
Where the rock stars the girdle of sea,<br />

Clipped by heat, rings the round of the tree.<br />
That hour of the piercing shaft<br />
Transfixes bough-shadows, confused<br />
In veins of fire, and she laughed,<br />
With her quiet mouth amused<br />
To see the whole flock, adroop,<br />
Asleep, hug the tree-stem as one,<br />
Imperceptibly filling the loop<br />
Of its shade at a slant of sun.<br />
The pipes under pent of the crag,<br />
Where the goatherds in piping recline,<br />
Have whimsical stops, burst and flag<br />
Uncorrected as outstretched swine:<br />
For the fingers are slack and unsure,<br />
And the wind issues querulous:&mdash;thorns<br />
And snakes!&mdash;but she listened demure,<br />
Comparing day&rsquo;s music with morn&rsquo;s.<br />
Of the gentle spirit that slips<br />
From the bark of the tree she discoursed,<br />
And of her of the wells, whose lips<br />
Are coolness enchanting, rock-sourced.<br />
And much of the sacred loon,<br />
The frolic, the Goatfoot God,<br />
For stories of indolent noon<br />
In the pineforest&rsquo;s odorous nod,<br />
She questioned, not knowing: he can<br />
Be waspish, irascible, rude,<br />
He is oftener friendly to man,<br />
And ever to beasts and their brood.<br />
For the which did she love him well,<br />
She said, and his pipes of the reed,<br />
His twitched lips puffing to tell<br />
In music his tears and his need,<br />
Against the sharp catch of his hurt.<br />
<a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Not as
shepherds of Pan did she speak,<br />
Nor spake as the schools, to divert,<br />
But fondly, perceiving him weak<br />
Before Gods, and to shepherds a fear,<br />
A holiness, horn and heel.<br />
All this she had learnt in her ear<br />
From Callistes, and taught him to feel.<br />
Yea, the solemn divinity flushed<br />
Through the shaggy brown skin of the beast,<br />
And the steeps where the cataract rushed,<br />
And the wilds where the forest is priest,<br />
Were his temple to clothe him in awe,<br />
While she spake: &rsquo;twas a wonder: she read<br />
The haunts of the beak and the claw<br />
As plain as the land of bread,<br />
But Cities and martial States,<br />
Whither soon the youth veered his theme,<br />
Were impervious barrier-gates<br />
To her: and that ship, a trireme,<br />
Nearing harbour, scarce wakened her glance,<br />
Though he dwelt on the message it bore<br />
Of sceptre and sword and lance<br />
To the bee-swarms black on the shore,<br />
Which were audible almost,<br />
So black they were.&nbsp; It befel<br />
That he called up the warrior host<br />
Of the Song pouring hydromel<br />
In thunder, the wide-winged Song.<br />
And he named with his boyish pride<br />
The heroes, the noble throng<br />
Past Acheron now, foul tide!<br />
With his joy of the godlike band<br />
And the verse divine, he named<br />
The chiefs pressing hot on the strand,<br />
Seen of Gods, of Gods aided, and maimed.<br />

She breathed as if breath had failed,<br />
And her eyes, while she bade him desist,<br />
Held the lost-to-light ghosts grey-mailed,<br />
As you see the grey river-mist<br />
Hold shapes on the yonder bank.<br />
A moment her body waned,<br />
The light of her sprang and sank:<br />
Then she looked at the sun, she regained<br />
Clear feature, and she breathed deep.<br />
She wore the wan smile he had seen,<br />
As the flow of the river of Sleep,<br />
On the mouth of the Shadow-Queen.<br />
In sunlight she craved to bask,<br />
Saying: Life!&nbsp; And who was she? who?<br />
Of what issue?&nbsp; He dared not ask,<br />

<p class="poetry">A noise of the hollow ground<br />
Turned the eye to the ear in debate:<br />
Not the soft overflowing of sound<br />
Of the pines, ranked, lofty, straight,<br />
Barely swayed to some whispers remote,<br />
Some swarming whispers above:<br />
Not the pines with the faint airs afloat,<br />
Hush-hushing the nested dove:<br />
It was not the pines, or the rout<br />
Oft heard from mid-forest in chase,<br />
But the long muffled roar of a shout<br />
Subterranean.&nbsp; Sharp grew her face.<br />
She rose, yet not moved by affright;<br />
<a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Her holiday of delight<br />
In the beams of the God of the Muse.<br />
And the steeps of the forest she crossed,<br />
On its dry red sheddings and cones<br />
Up the paths by roots green-mossed,<br />
Spotted amber, and old mossed stones.<br />
Then out where the brook-torrent starts<br />
To her leap, and from bend to curve<br />
A hurrying elbow darts<br />
For the instant-glancing swerve,<br />
Decisive, with violent will<br />
In the action formed, like hers,<br />
The maiden&rsquo;s, ascending; and still<br />
Ascending, the bud of the furze,<br />
The broom, and all blue-berried shoots<br />
Of stubborn and prickly kind,<br />
The juniper flat on its roots,<br />
The dwarf rhododaphne, behind<br />
She left, and the mountain sheep<br />
Far behind, goat, herbage and flower.<br />
The island was hers, and the deep,<br />
All heaven, a golden hour.<br />
Then with wonderful voice, that rang<br />
Through air as the swan&rsquo;s nigh death,<br />
Of the glory of Light she sang,<br />
She sang of the rapture of Breath.<br />
Nor ever, says he who heard,<br />
Heard Earth in her boundaries broad,<br />
From bosom of singer or bird<br />
A sweetness thus rich of the God<br />
Whose harmonies always are sane.<br />
She sang of furrow and seed,<br />
The burial, birth of the grain,<br />
The growth, and the showers that feed,<br />
<a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>And the
green blades waxing mature<br />
For the husbandman&rsquo;s armful brown.<br />
O, the song in its burden ran pure,<br />
And burden to song was a crown.<br />
Callistes, a singer, skilled<br />
In the gift he could measure and praise,<br />
By a rival&rsquo;s art was thrilled,<br />
Though she sang but a Song of Days,<br />
Where the husbandman&rsquo;s toil and strife<br />
Little varies to strife and toil:<br />
But the milky kernel of life,<br />
With her numbered: corn, wine, fruit, oil<br />
The song did give him to eat:<br />
Gave the first rapt vision of Good,<br />
And the fresh young sense of Sweet<br />
The grace of the battle for food,<br />
With the issue Earth cannot refuse<br />
When men to their labour are sworn.<br />
&rsquo;Twas a song of the God of the Muse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the forehead of Morn.</p>

<p class="poetry">Him loved she.&nbsp; Lo, now was he veiled:<br
/>
Over sea stood a swelled cloud-rack:<br />
The fishing-boat heavenward sailed,<br />
Bent abeam, with a whitened track,<br />
Surprised, fast hauling the net,<br />
As it flew: sea dashed, earth shook.<br />
She said: Is it night?&nbsp; O not yet!<br />
With a travail of thoughts in her look.<br />
The mountain heaved up to its peak:<br />
Sea darkened: earth gathered her fowl;<br />
Of bird or of branch rose the shriek.<br />
Night? but never so fell a scowl<br />
Wore night, nor the sky since then<br />
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>When ocean
ran swallowing shore,<br />
And the Gods looked down for men.<br />
Broke tempest with that stern roar<br />
Never yet, save when black on the whirl<br />
Rode wrath of a sovereign Power.<br />
Then the youth and the shuddering girl,<br />
Dim as shades in the angry shower,<br />
Joined hands and descended a maze<br />
Of the paths that were racing alive<br />
Round boulder and bush, cleaving ways,<br />
Incessant, with sound of a hive.<br />
The height was a fountain-urn<br />
Pouring streams, and the whole solid height<br />
Leaped, chasing at every turn<br />
The pair in one spirit of flight<br />
To the folding pineforest.&nbsp; Yet here,<br />
Like the pause to things hunted, in doubt,<br />
The stillness bred spectral fear<br />
Of the awfulness ranging without,<br />
And imminent.&nbsp; Downward they fled,<br />
From under the haunted roof,<br />
To the valley aquake with the tread<br />
Of an iron-resounding hoof,<br />
As of legions of thunderful horse<br />
Broken loose and in line tramping hard.<br />
For the rage of a hungry force<br />
Roamed blind of its mark over sward:<br />
They saw it rush dense in the cloak<br />
Of its travelling swathe of steam;<br />
All the vale through a thin thread-smoke<br />
Was thrown back to distance extreme:<br />
And dull the full breast of it blinked,<br />
Like a buckler of steel breathed o&rsquo;er,<br />
Diminished, in strangeness distinct,<br />
Glowing cold, unearthly, hoar:<br />
<a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>An Enna of
fields beyond sun,<br />
Out of light, in a lurid web;<br />
And the traversing fury spun<br />
Up and down with a wave&rsquo;s flow and ebb;<br />
As the wave breaks to grasp and to spurn,<br />
Retire, and in ravenous greed,<br />
Inveterate, swell its return.<br />
Up and down, as if wringing from speed<br />
Sights that made the unsighted appear,<br />
Delude and dissolve, on it scoured.<br />
Lo, a sea upon land held career<br />
Through the plain of the vale half-devoured.<br />
Callistes of home and escape<br />
Muttered swiftly, unwitting of speech.<br />
She gazed at the Void of shape,<br />
She put her white hand to his reach,<br />
Saying: Now have we looked on the Three.<br />
And divided from day, from night,<br />
From air that is breath, stood she,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the vale, out of light.</p>
<h4>X</h4>
<p class="poetry">Then again in disorderly words<br />
He muttered of home, and was mute,<br />
With the heart of the cowering birds<br />
Ere they burst off the fowler&rsquo;s foot.<br />
He gave her some redness that streamed<br />
Through her limbs in a flitting glow.<br />
The sigh of our life she seemed,<br />
The bliss of it clothing in woe.<br />
Frailer than flower when the round<br />
Of the sickle encircles it: strong<br />
To tell of the things profound,<br />
Our inmost uttering song,<br />
Unspoken.&nbsp; So stood she awhile<br />
<a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>In the
gloom of the terror afield,<br />
And the silence about her smile<br />
Said more than of tongue is revealed.<br />
I have breathed: I have gazed: I have been:<br />
It said: and not joylessly shone<br />
The remembrance of light through the screen<br />
Of a face that seemed shadow and stone.<br />
She led the youth trembling, appalled,<br />
To the lake-banks he saw sink and rise<br />
Like a panic-struck breast.&nbsp; Then she called,<br />
And the hurricane blackness had eyes.<br />
It launched like the Thunderer&rsquo;s bolt.<br />
Pale she drooped, and the youth by her side<br />
Would have clasped her and dared a revolt<br />
Sacrilegious as ever defied<br />
High Olympus, but vainly for strength<br />
His compassionate heart shook a frame<br />
Stricken rigid to ice all its length.<br />
On amain the black traveller came.<br />
Lo, a chariot, cleaving the storm,<br />
Clove the fountaining lake with a plough,<br />
And the lord of the steeds was in form<br />
He, the God of implacable brow,<br />
Darkness: he: he in person: he raged<br />
Through the wave like a boar of the wilds<br />
From the hunters and hounds disengaged,<br />
And a name shouted hoarsely: his child&rsquo;s.<br />
Horror melted in anguish to hear.<br />
Lo, the wave hissed apart for the path<br />
Of the terrible Charioteer,<br />
With the foam and torn features of wrath,<br />
Hurled aloft on each arm in a sheet;<br />
And the steeds clove it, rushing at land<br />
Like the teeth of the famished at meat.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he swept out his hand.</p>
<h4><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="poetry">This, no more, doth Callistes recall:<br />
He saw, ere he dropped in swoon,<br />
On the maiden the chariot fall,<br />
As a thundercloud swings on the moon.<br />
Forth, free of the deluge, one cry<br />
From the vanishing gallop rose clear:<br />
And: Ski&aacute;geneia! the sky<br />
Rang; Ski&aacute;geneia! the sphere.<br />
And she left him therewith, to rejoice,<br />
Repine, yearn, and know not his aim,<br />
The life of their day in her voice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Left her life in her name.</p>
<h4>XII</h4>
<p class="poetry">Now the valley in ruin of fields<br />
And fair meadowland, showing at eve<br />
Like the spear-pitted warrior&rsquo;s shields<br />
After battle, bade men believe<br />
That no other than wrathfullest God<br />
Had been loose on her beautiful breast,<br />
Where the flowery grass was clod,<br />
Wheat and vine as a trailing nest.<br />
The valley, discreet in grief,<br />
Disclosed but the open truth,<br />
And Enna had hope of the sheaf:<br />
There was none for the desolate youth<br />
Devoted to mourn and to crave.<br />
Of the secret he had divined<br />
Of his friend of a day would he rave:<br />
How for light of our earth she pined:<br />
For the olive, the vine and the wheat,<br />
Burning through with inherited fire:<br />
And when Mother went Mother to meet,<br />
She was prompted by simple desire<br />
<a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>In the
day-destined car to have place<br />
At the skirts of the Goddess, unseen,<br />
And be drawn to the dear earth&rsquo;s face.<br />
She was fire for the blue and the green<br />
Of our earth, dark fire; athirst<br />
As a seed of her bosom for dawn,<br />
White air that had robed and nursed<br />
Her mother.&nbsp; Now was she gone<br />
With the Silent, the God without tear,<br />
Like a bud peeping out of its sheath<br />
To be sundered and stamped with the sere.<br />
And Callistes to her beneath,<br />
As she to our beams, extinct,<br />
Strained arms: he was shade of her shade.<br />
In division so were they linked.<br />
But the song which had betrayed<br />
Her flight to the cavernous ear<br />
For its own keenly wakeful: that song<br />
Of the sowing and reaping, and cheer<br />
Of the husbandman&rsquo;s heart made strong<br />
Through droughts and deluging rains<br />
With his faith in the Great Mother&rsquo;s love:<br />
O the joy of the breath she sustains,<br />
And the lyre of the light above,<br />
And the first rapt vision of Good,<br />
And the fresh young sense of Sweet:<br />
That song the youth ever pursued<br />
In the track of her footing fleet.<br />
For men to be profited much<br />
By her day upon earth did he sing:<br />
Of her voice, and her steps, and her touch<br />
On the blossoms of tender Spring,<br />
Immortal: and how in her soul<br />
She is with them, and tearless abides,<br />
Folding grain of a love for one goal<br />
<a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>In
patience, past flowing of tides.<br />
And if unto him she was tears,<br />
He wept not: he wasted within:<br />
Seeming sane in the song, to his peers,<br />
Only crazed where the cravings begin.<br />
Our Lady of Gifts prized he less<br />
Than her issue in darkness: the dim<br />
Lost Ski&aacute;gencia&rsquo;s caress<br />
Of our earth made it richest for him.<br />
And for that was a curse on him raised,<br />
And he withered rathe, dry to his prime,<br />
Though the bounteous Giver be praised<br />
Through the island with rites of old time<br />
Exceedingly fervent, and reaped<br />
Veneration for teachings devout,<br />
Pious hymns when the corn-sheaves are heaped<br />
And the wine-presses ruddily spout,<br />
And the olive and apple are juice<br />
At a touch light as hers lost below.<br />
Whatsoever to men is of use<br />
Sprang his worship of them who bestow,<br />
In a measure of songs unexcelled:<br />
But that soul loving earth and the sun<br />
From her home of the shadows he held<br />
For his beacon where beam there is none:<br />
And to join her, or have her brought back,<br />
In his frenzy the singer would call,<br />
Till he followed where never was track,<br />
On the path trod of all.</p>

Of many links without a break,<br />
In chirrup, whistle, slur and shake,<br />
All intervolved and spreading wide,<br />

Where ripple ripple overcurls<br />

By simple singing of delight;<br />
Shrill, irreflective, unrestrained,<br />
Rapt, ringing, on the jet sustained<br />
Without a break, without a fall,<br />
Sweet-silvery, sheer lyrical,<br />
Perennial, quavering up the chord<br />
Like myriad dews of sunny sward<br />
That trembling into fulness shine,<br />
And sparkle dropping argentine;<br />
Such wooing as the ear receives<br />
From zephyr caught in choric leaves<br />
Of aspens when their chattering net<br />
Is flushed to white with shivers wet;<br />

On mountain heights in morning&rsquo;s prime,<br />

Too animate to need a stress;<br />

Awakening, as it waxes thin,<br />

Puts on the light of children praised;<br />
So rich our human pleasure ripes<br />

Their tongues to lick him: the swift affectionate tongue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of each ran licking the slumberer: then his ears<br

A forked red tongue tickled shrewdly: sudden upsprung,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard a voice piping: Ay, for he has no
fears!</p>
<h4>VI</h4>
<p class="poetry">A bird said that, in the notes of birds, and
the speech<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of men, it seemed: and another renewed: He moves<br

To learn and not to pursue, he gathers to teach;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He feeds his young as do we, and as we love
loves.<br />
No fears have I of a man who goes with his head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To earth, chance looking aloft at us, kind of
hand:<br />
I feel to him as to earth of whom we are fed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I pipe him much for his good could he
understand.</p>

<p class="poetry">Melampus touched at his ears, laid finger on
wrist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was not dreaming, he sensibly felt and heard.<br
/>
Above, through leaves, where the tree-twigs inter-twist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He spied the birds and the bill of the speaking
bird.<br />
His cushion mosses in shades of various green,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lumped, the antlered, he pressed, while the
sunny snake<br />
Slipped under: draughts he had drunk of clear Hippocrene,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It seemed, and sat with a gift of the Gods
awake.</p>
<h4>VIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">Divinely thrilled was the man, exultingly
full,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As quick well-waters that come of the heart of
earth,<br />
Ere yet they dart in a brook are one bubble-pool<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To light and sound, wedding both at the leap of
birth.<br />
The soul of light vivid shone, a stream within stream;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The soul of sound from a musical shell outflew;<br
/>
Where others hear but a hum and see but a beam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tongue and eye of the fountain of life he
knew.</p>
<h4>IX</h4>
<p class="poetry">He knew the Hours: they were round him, laden
with seed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of hours bestrewn upon vapour, and one by one<br />
They winged as ripened in fruit the burden decreed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For each to scatter; they flushed like the buds in
sun,<br />
Bequeathing seed to successive similar rings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their sisters, bearers to men of what men have
earned:<br />
He knew them, talked with the yet unreddened; the stings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sweets, they warmed at their bosoms divined,
discerned.</p>
<h4><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>X</h4>
<p class="poetry">Not unsolicited, sought by diligent feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By riddling fingers expanded, oft watched in

With brooding deep as the noon-ray&rsquo;s quickening wheat,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere touch&rsquo;d, the pendulous flower of the
plants of sloth,<br />
The plants of rigidness, answered question and squeeze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Revealing wherefore it bloomed, uninviting, bent,<br
/>
Yet making harmony breathe of life and disease,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The deeper chord of a wonderful instrument.</p>
<h4>XI</h4>
<p class="poetry">So passed he luminous-eyed for earth and the
fates<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We arm to bruise or caress us: his ears were
charged<br />
With tones of love in a whirl of voluble hates,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With music wrought of distraction his heart
enlarged.<br />
Celestial-shining, though mortal, singer, though mute,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He drew the Master of harmonies, voiced or
stilled,<br />
To seek him; heard at the silent medicine-root<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A song, beheld in fulfilment the unfulfilled.</p>

<p class="poetry">Him Phoebus, lending to darkness colour and

rave,<br />
And how acquired, of the zeal of love to acquire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And where it stands, in the centre of life a
sphere;<br />
And Measure, mood of the lyre, the rapturous lyre,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He said was Wisdom, and struck him the notes to
hear.</p>

honey, the breeze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In heat, the run of the river on root and stone,<br

All senses joined, as the sister Pierides<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are one, uplifting their chorus, the Nine, his
own.<br />
In stately order, evolved of sound into sight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From sight to sound intershifting, the man
descried<br />
The growths of earth, his adored, like day out of night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ascend in song, seeing nature and song allied.</p>
<h4>XIV</h4>
<p class="poetry">And there vitality, there, there solely in
song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Resides, where earth and her uses to men, their
needs,<br />
Their forceful cravings, the theme are: there is it strong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Master said: and the studious eye that reads,<br
/>
(Yea, even as earth to the crown of Gods on the mount),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In links divine with the lyrical tongue is bound.<br

Pursue thy craft: it is music drawn of a fount<br />

ground.</p>

<p class="poetry">Melampus dwelt among men: physician and
sage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He served them, loving them, healing them; sick or
maimed,<br />
Or them that frenzied in some delirious rage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Outran the measure, his juice of the woods
reclaimed.<br />
He played on men, as his master, Phoebus, on strings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Melodious: as the God did he drive and check,<br />
Through love exceeding a simple love of the things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That glide in grasses and rubble of woody wreck.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Like iron runlets of the heath.<br />
Dispersed lay broth-pot, sticks, and drinking-can.</p>
<p class="poetry">Three girls, with shoulders like a boat at
sea<br />
Tipped sideways by the wave (their clothing slid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From either ridge unequally),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lean, swift and voluble, bestrid<br />
A starting-point, unfrocked to the bent knee.</p>
<p class="poetry">They raced; their brothers yelled them on, and
broke<br />
In act to follow, but as one they snuffed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wood-fumes, and by the fire that spoke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of provender, its pale flame puffed,<br />
And rolled athwart dwarf furzes grey-blue smoke.</p>
<p class="poetry">Soon on the dark edge of a ruddier gleam,<br />
The mother-pot perusing, all, stretched flat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Paused for its bubbling-up supreme:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A dog upright in circle sat,<br />
And oft his nose went with the flying steam.</p>
<p class="poetry">I turned and looked on heaven awhile, where
now<br />
The moor-faced sunset broadened with red light;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Threw high aloft a golden bough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And seemed the desert of the night<br />
Far down with mellow orchards to endow.</p>

That nourishment, she cannot give: his heart<br />
Involves his fate; and she who urged the start<br />
Abides the race.</p>

Contentious with the elements, whose dower<br />

Is warning of a creature matched with strife,<br />
To meet it as a bride, or let fall life<br />
On life&rsquo;s accursed.</p>

Her calm, her care.</p>

BALLAD OF FAIR LADIES IN REVOLT</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">See</span> the sweet women,
friend, that lean beneath<br />
The ever-falling fountain of green leaves<br />
Round the white bending stem, and like a wreath<br />
Of our most blushful flower shine trembling through,<br />
To teach philosophers the thirst of thieves:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is one for me? is one for you?</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Fair sirs, we give you welcome, yield
you place,<br />
And you shall choose among us which you will,<br />
Without the idle pastime of the chase,<br />
If to this treaty you can well agree:<br />
To wed our cause, and its high task fulfil.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He who&rsquo;s for us, for him are we!</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Most gracious ladies, nigh when light
has birth,<br />
A troop of maids, brown as burnt heather-bells,<br />
And rich with life as moss-roots breathe of earth<br />
In the first plucking of them, past us flew<br />
To labour, singing rustic ritornells:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had they a cause? are they of you?</p>
<h4><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>IV</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Sirs, they are as unthinking armies
are<br />
To thoughtful leaders, and our cause is theirs.<br />
When they know men they know the state of war:<br />
But now they dream like sunlight on a sea,<br />
And deem you hold the half of happy pairs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He who&rsquo;s for us, for him are we!</p>
<h4>V</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Ladies, I listened to a ring of
dames;<br />
Judicial in the robe and wig; secure<br />
As venerated portraits in their frames;<br />
And they denounced some insurrection new<br />
Against sound laws which keep you good and pure.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you of them? are they of you?</p>
<h4>VI</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Sirs, they are of us, as their dress
denotes,<br />
And by as much: let them together chime:<br />
It is an ancient bell within their throats,<br />
Pulled by an aged ringer; with what glee<br />
Befits the yellow yesterdays of time.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He who&rsquo;s for us, for him are we!</p>
<h4>VII</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Sweet ladies, you with beauty, you with
wit;<br />
Dowered of all favours and all blessed things<br />
Whereat the ruddy torch of Love is lit;<br />
Wherefore this vain and outworn strife renew,<br />
Which stays the tide no more than eddy-rings?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is for love must be for you.</p>

<p class="poetry">&mdash;The manners of the market, honest
sirs,<br />
&rsquo;Tis hard to quit when you behold the wares.<br />
You flatter us, or perchance our milliners<br />
You flatter; so this vain and outworn She<br />
May still be the charmed snake to your soft airs!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A higher lord than Love claim we.</p>
<h4>IX</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;One day, dear lady, missing the broad
track,<br />
I came on a wood&rsquo;s border, by a mead,<br />
Where golden May ran up to moted black:<br />
And there I saw Queen Beauty hold review,<br />
With Love before her throne in act to plead.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Take him for me, take her for you.</p>
<h4>X</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Ingenious gentleman, the tale is
known.<br />
Love pleaded sweetly: Beauty would not melt:<br />
She would not melt: he turned in wrath: her throne<br />
The shadow of his back froze witheringly,<br />
And sobbing at his feet Queen Beauty knelt.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O not such slaves of Love are we!</p>
<h4>XI</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Love, lady, like the star above that
lance<br />
Of radiance flung by sunset on ridged cloud,<br />
Sad as the last line of a brave romance!&mdash;<br />
Young Love hung dim, yet quivering round him threw<br />
Beams of fresh fire, while Beauty waned and bowed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scorn Love, and dread the doom for you.</p>
<h4><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>XII</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Called she not for her mirror,
sir?&nbsp; Forth ran<br />
Her women: I am lost, she cried, when lo,<br />
Love in the form of an admiring man<br />
Once more in adoration bent the knee,<br />
And brought the faded Pagan to full blow:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For which her throne she gave: not we!</p>
<h4>XIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;My version, madam, runs not to that
end.<br />
A certain madness of an hour half past,<br />
Caught her like fever; her just lord no friend<br />
She fancied; aimed beyond beauty, and thence grew<br />
The prim acerbity, sweet Love&rsquo;s outcast.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Great heaven ward off that stroke from you!</p>
<h4>XIV</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Your prayer to heaven, good sir, is
generous:<br />
How generous likewise that you do not name<br />
Offended nature!&nbsp; She from all of us<br />
Couched idle underneath our showering tree,<br />
May quite withhold her most destructive flame;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then what woeful women we!</p>
<h4>XV</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Quite, could not be, fair lady; yet your
youth<br />
May run to drought in visionary schemes:<br />
And a late waking to perceive the truth,<br />
When day falls shrouding her supreme adieu,<br />
Shows darker wastes than unaccomplished dreams:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that may be in store for you.</p>
<h4><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>XVI</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;O sir, the truth, the truth! is&rsquo;t
in the skies,<br />
Or in the grass, or in this heart of ours?<br />
But O the truth, the truth! the many eyes<br />
That look on it! the diverse things they see,<br />
According to their thirst for fruit or flowers!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass on: it is the truth seek we.</p>
<h4>XVII</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Lady, there is a truth of settled
laws<br />
That down the past burns like a great watch-fire.<br />
Let youth hail changeful mornings; but your cause,<br />
Whetting its edge to cut the race in two,<br />
Is felony: you forfeit the bright lyre,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Much honour and much glory you!</p>
<h4>XVIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Sir, was it glory, was it honour,
pride,<br />
And not as cat and serpent and poor slave,<br />
Wherewith we walked in union by your side?<br />
Spare to false womanliness her delicacy,<br />
Or bid true manliness give ear, we crave:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In our defence thus chained are we.</p>
<h4>XIX</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Yours, madam, were the privileges of
life<br />
Proper to man&rsquo;s ideal; you were the mark<br />
Of action, and the banner in the strife:<br />
Yea, of your very weakness once you drew<br />
The strength that sounds the wells, outflies the lark:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrapped in a robe of flame were you!</p>
<h4><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>XX</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Your friend looks thoughtful.&nbsp; Sir,
when we were chill,<br />
You clothed us warmly; all in honour! when<br />
We starved you fed us; all in honour still:<br />
Oh, all in honour, ultra-honourably!<br />
Deep is the gratitude we owe to men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For privileged indeed were we!</p>
<h4>XXI</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;You cite exceptions, madam, that are
sad,<br />
But come in the red struggle of our growth.<br />
Alas, that I should have to say it! bad<br />
Is two-sexed upon earth: this which you do,<br />
Shows animal impatience, mental sloth:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Man monstrous! pining seraphs you!</p>
<h4>XXII</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;I fain would ask your friend . . . but I
will ask<br />
You, sir, how if in place of numbers vague,<br />
Your sad exceptions were to break that mask<br />
They wear for your cool mind historically,<br />
And blaze like black lists of a <i>present</i> plague?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But in that light behold them we.</p>
<h4>XXIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Your spirit breathes a mist upon our
world,<br />
Lady, and like a rain to pierce the roof<br />
And drench the bed where toil-tossed man lies curled<br />
In his hard-earned oblivion!&nbsp; You are few,<br />
Scattered, ill-counselled, blinded: for a proof,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lived, and have known none like you.</p>
<h4><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>XXIV</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;We may be blind to men, sir: we
embrace<br />
A future now beyond the fowler&rsquo;s nets.<br />
Though few, we hold a promise for the race<br />
That was not at our rising: you are free<br />
To win brave mates; you lose but marionnettes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He who&rsquo;s for us, for him are we.</p>
<h4>XXV</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Ah! madam, were they puppets who
withstood<br />
Youth&rsquo;s cravings for adventure to preserve<br />
The dedicated ways of womanhood?<br />
The light which leads us from the paths of rue,<br />
That light above us, never seen to swerve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should be the home-lamp trimmed by you.</p>
<h4>XXVI</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Ah! sir, our worshipped posture we
perchance<br />
Shall not abandon, though we see not how,<br />
Being to that lamp-post fixed, we may advance<br />
Beside our lords in any real degree,<br />
Unless we move: and to advance is now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A sovereign need, think more than we.</p>
<h4>XXVII</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;So push you out of harbour in small
craft,<br />
With little seamanship; and comes a gale,<br />
The world will laugh, the world has often laughed,<br />
Lady, to see how bold when skies are blue,<br />
When black winds churn the deeps how panic-pale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How swift to the old nest fly you!</p>
<h4><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>XXVIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;What thinks your friend, kind sir?&nbsp;
We have escaped<br />
But partly that old half-tamed wild beast&rsquo;s paw<br />
Whereunder woman, the weak thing, was shaped:<br />
Men, too, have known the cramping enemy<br />
In grim brute force, whom force of brain shall awe:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Him our deliverer, await we!</p>
<h4>XXIX</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Delusions are with eloquence endowed,<br
/>
And yours might pluck an angel from the spheres<br />
To play in this revolt whereto you are vowed,<br />
Deliverer, lady! but like summer dew<br />
O&rsquo;er fields that crack for rain your friends drop tears,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who see the awakening for you.</p>
<h4>XXX</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Is he our friend, there silent? he weeps
not.<br />
O sir, delusion mounting like a sun<br />
On a mind blank as the white wife of Lot,<br />
Giving it warmth and movement! if this be<br />
Delusion, think of what thereby was won<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For men, and dream of what win we.</p>
<h4>XXXI</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Lady, the destiny of minor powers,<br />
Who would recast us, is but to convulse:<br />
You enter on a strife that frets and sours;<br />
You can but win sick disappointment&rsquo;s hue;<br />
And simply an accelerated pulse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some tonic you have drunk moves you.</p>
<h4><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>XXXII</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Thinks your friend so?&nbsp; Good sir,
your wit is bright;<br />
But wit that strives to speak the popular voice,<br />
Puts on its nightcap and puts out its light.<br />
Curfew, would seem your conqueror&rsquo;s decree<br />
To women likewise: and we have no choice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save darkness or rebellion, we!</p>
<h4>XXXIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;A plain safe intermediate way is
cleft<br />
By reason foiling passion: you that rave<br />
Of mad alternatives to right and left<br />
Echo the tempter, madam: and &rsquo;tis due<br />
Unto your sex to shun it as the grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This later apple offered you.</p>
<h4>XXXIV</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;This apple is not ripe, it is not
sweet;<br />
Nor rosy, sir, nor golden: eye and mouth<br />
Are little wooed by it; yet we would eat.<br />
We are somewhat tired of Eden, is our plea.<br />
We have thirsted long; this apple suits our drouth:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis good for men to halve, think we.</p>
<h4>XXXV</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;But say, what seek you, madam?&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis enough<br />
That you should have dominion o&rsquo;er the springs<br />
Domestic and man&rsquo;s heart: those ways, how rough,<br />
How vile, outside the stately avenue<br />
Where you walk sheltered by your angel&rsquo;s wings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are happily unknown to you.</p>
<h4><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="poetry">&mdash;We hear women&rsquo;s shrieks on
them.&nbsp; We like your phrase,<br />
Dominion domestic!&nbsp; And that roar,<br />
&lsquo;What seek you?&rsquo; is of tyrants in all days.<br />
Sir, get you something of our purity<br />
And we will of your strength: we ask no more.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the sum of what seek we.</p>
<h4>XXXVII</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;O for an image, madam, in one word,<br
/>
To show you as the lightning night reveals,<br />
Your error and your perils: you have erred<br />
In mind only, and the perils that ensue<br />
Swift heels may soften; wherefore to swift heels<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Address your hopes of safety you!</p>
<h4>XXXVIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;To err in mind, sir . . . your friend
smiles: he may!<br />
To err in mind, if err in mind we can,<br />
Is grievous error you do well to stay.<br />
But O how different from reality<br />
Men&rsquo;s fiction is! how like you in the plan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is woman, knew you her as we!</p>
<h4>XXXIX</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Look, lady, where yon river winds its
line<br />
Toward sunset, and receives on breast and face<br />
The splendour of fair life: to be divine,<br />
&rsquo;Tis nature bids you be to nature true,<br />
Flowing with beauty, lending earth your grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reflecting heaven in clearness you.</p>
<h4><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>XL</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Sir, you speak well: your friend no word
vouchsafes.<br />
To flow with beauty, breeding fools and worse,<br />
Cowards and worse: at such fair life she chafes,<br />
Who is not wholly of the nursery,<br />
Nor of your schools: we share the primal curse;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Together shake it off, say we!</p>
<h4>XLI</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Hear, then, my friend, madam!&nbsp;
Tongue-restrained he stands<br />
Till words are thoughts, and thoughts, like swords enriched<br />
With traceries of the artificer&rsquo;s hands,<br />
Are fire-proved steel to cut, fair flowers to view.&mdash;<br />
Do I hear him?&nbsp; Oh, he is bewitched, bewitched!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heed him not!&nbsp; Traitress beauties you!</p>
<h4>XLII</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;We have won a champion, sisters, and a
sage!<br />
&mdash;Ladies, you win a guest to a good feast!<br />
&mdash;Sir spokesman, sneers are weakness veiling rage.<br />

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">When</span> the South sang
like a nightingale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above a bower in May,<br />
The training of Love&rsquo;s vine of flame<br />
Was writ in laws, for lord and dame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To say their yea and nay.</p>
<h5>II</h5>
<p class="poetry">When the South sang like a nightingale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the flowering night,<br />
And lord and dame held gentle sport,<br />
There came a young princess to Court,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A frost of beauty white.</p>
<h5>III</h5>
<p class="poetry">The South sang like a nightingale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To thaw her glittering dream:<br />
No vine of Love her bosom gave,<br />
She drank no wine of Love, but grave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She held them to Love&rsquo;s theme.</p>
<h5>IV</h5>
<p class="poetry">The South grew all a nightingale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath a moon unmoved:<br />
Like the banner of war she led them on;<br />
She left them to lie, like the light that has gone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From wine-cups overproved.</p>

<p class="poetry">When the South was a fervid nightingale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she a chilling moon,<br />
&rsquo;Twas pity to see on the garden swards,<br />
Against Love&rsquo;s laws, those rival lords<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As willow-wands lie strewn.</p>
<h5>VI</h5>
<p class="poetry">The South had throat of a nightingale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For her, the young princess:<br />
She gave no vine of Love to rear,<br />
Love&rsquo;s wine drank not, yet bent her ear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To themes of Love no less.</p>

<p class="poetry">The lords of the Court they sighed
heart-sick,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heart-free Lord Dusiote laughed:<br />
I prize her no more than a fling o&rsquo; the dice,<br />
But, or shame to my manhood, a lady of ice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We master her by craft!</p>
<h5>II</h5>
<p class="poetry">Heart-sick the lords of joyance yawned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord Dusiote laughed heart-free:<br />
I count her as much as a crack o&rsquo; my thumb,<br />
But, or shame of my manhood, to me she shall come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the bird to roost in the tree!</p>
<h5>III</h5>
<p class="poetry">At dead of night when the palace-guard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had passed the measured rounds,<br />
The young princess awoke to feel<br />
A shudder of blood at the crackle of steel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the garden-bounds.</p>
<h5>IV</h5>
<p class="poetry">It ceased, and she thought of whom was need,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The friar or the leech;<br />
When lo, stood her tirewoman breathless by:<br />
Lord Dusiote, madam, to death is nigh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of you he would have speech.</p>
<h5><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="poetry">He prays you of your gentleness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To light him to his dark end.<br />
The princess rose, and forth she went,<br />
For charity was her intent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Devoutly to befriend.</p>
<h5>VI</h5>
<p class="poetry">Lord Dusiote hung on his good squire&rsquo;s
arm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The priest beside him knelt:<br />
A weeping handkerchief was pressed<br />
To stay the red flood at his breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bid cold ladies melt.</p>
<h5>VII</h5>
<p class="poetry">O lady, though you are ice to men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All pure to heaven as light<br />
Within the dew within the flower,<br />
Of you &rsquo;tis whispered that love has power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When secret is the night.</p>
<h5>VIII</h5>
<p class="poetry">I have silenced the slanderers, peace to their
souls!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save one was too cunning for me.<br />
I die, whose love is late avowed,<br />
He lives, who boasts the lily has bowed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the oath of a bended knee.</p>
<h5>IX</h5>
<p class="poetry">Lord Dusiote drew breath with pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she with pain drew breath:<br />
On him she looked, on his like above;<br />
She flew in the folds of a marvel of love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Revealed to pass to death.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; You are dying for me, she cried;<br />
O take my hand, O take my kiss,<br />
And take of your right for love like this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The vow that plights me bride.</p>
<h5>XI</h5>
<p class="poetry">She bade the priest recite his words<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While hand in hand were they,<br />
Lord Dusiote&rsquo;s soul to waft to bliss;<br />
He had her hand, her vow, her kiss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his body was borne away.</p>

<h5>I</h5>
<p class="poetry">Lord Dusiote sprang from priest and squire;<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; He gazed at her lighted room:<br />
The laughter in his heart grew slack;<br />
He knew not the force that pushed him back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From her and the morn in bloom.</p>
<h5>II</h5>
<p class="poetry">Like a drowned man&rsquo;s length on the strong
flood-tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the shade of a bird in the sun,<br />
He fled from his lady whom he might claim<br />
As ghost, and who made the daybeams flame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To scare what he had done.</p>
<h5>III</h5>
<p class="poetry">There was grief at Court for one so gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though he was a lord less keen<br />
For training the vine than at vintage-press;<br />
But in her soul the young princess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Believed that love had been.</p>
<h5>IV</h5>
<p class="poetry">Lord Dusiote fled the Court and land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He crossed the woeful seas,<br />
Till his traitorous doing seemed clearer to burn,<br />
And the lady beloved drew his heart for return,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the banner of war in the breeze.</p>
<h5><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="poetry">He neared the palace, he spied the Court,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And music he heard, and they told<br />
Of foreign lords arrived to bring<br />
The nuptial gifts of a bridegroom king<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the princess grave and cold.</p>
<h5>VI</h5>
<p class="poetry">The masque and the dance were cloud on wave,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And down the masque and the dance<br />
Lord Dusiote stepped from dame to dame,<br />
And to the young princess he came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bow and a burning glance.</p>
<h5>VII</h5>
<p class="poetry">Do you take a new husband to-morrow, lady?<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; She shrank as at prick of steel.<br />
Must the first yield place to the second, he sighed.<br />
Her eyes were like the grave that is wide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the corpse from head to heel.</p>
<h5>VIII</h5>
<p class="poetry">My lady, my love, that little hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has mine ringed fast in plight:<br />
I bear for your lips a lawful thirst,<br />
And as justly the second should follow the first,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I come to your door this night.</p>
<h5>IX</h5>
<p class="poetry">If a ghost should come a ghost will go:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No more the lady said,<br />
Save that ever when he in wrath began<br />
To swear by the faith of a living man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She answered him, You are dead.</p>

<h5>I</h5>
<p class="poetry">The soft night-wind went laden to death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With smell of the orange in flower;<br />
The light leaves prattled to neighbour ears;<br />
The bird of the passion sang over his tears;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The night named hour by hour.</p>
<h5>II</h5>
<p class="poetry">Sang loud, sang low the rapturous bird<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the yellow hour was nigh,<br />
Behind the folds of a darker cloud:<br />
He chuckled, he sobbed, alow, aloud;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice between earth and sky.</p>
<h5>III</h5>
<p class="poetry">O will you, will you, women are weak;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The proudest are yielding mates<br />
For a forward foot and a tongue of fire:<br />
So thought Lord Dusiote&rsquo;s trusty squire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At watch by the palace-gates.</p>
<h5>IV</h5>
<p class="poetry">The song of the bird was wine in his blood,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And woman the odorous bloom:<br />
His master&rsquo;s great adventure stirred<br />
Within him to mingle the bloom and bird,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And morn ere its coming illume.</p>
<h5><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="poetry">Beside him strangely a piece of the dark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had moved, and the undertones<br />
Of a priest in prayer, like a cavernous wave,<br />
He heard, as were there a soul to save<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For urgency now in the groans.</p>
<h5>VI</h5>
<p class="poetry">No priest was hired for the play this night:<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the squire tossed head like a deer<br />
At sniff of the tainted wind; he gazed<br />
Where cresset-lamps in a door were raised,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Belike on a passing bier.</p>
<h5>VII</h5>
<p class="poetry">All cloaked and masked, with naked blades,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That flashed of a judgement done,<br />
The lords of the Court, from the palace-door,<br />
Came issuing silently, bearers four,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And flat on their shoulders one.</p>
<h5>VIII</h5>
<p class="poetry">They marched the body to squire and priest,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; They lowered it sad to earth:<br />
The priest they gave the burial dole,<br />
Bade wrestle hourly for his soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who was a lord of worth.</p>
<h5>IX</h5>
<p class="poetry">One said, farewell to a gallant knight!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And one, but a restless ghost!<br />
&rsquo;Tis a year and a day since in this place<br />
He died, sped high by a lady of grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To join the blissful host.</p>
<h5><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>X</h5>
<p class="poetry">Not vainly on us she charged her cause,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lady whom we revere<br />
For faith in the mask of a love untrue<br />
To the Love we honour, the Love her due,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Love we have vowed to rear.</p>
<h5>XI</h5>
<p class="poetry">A trap for the sweet tooth, lures for the
light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the fortress defiant a mine:<br />
Right well!&nbsp; But not in the South, princess,<br />
Shall the lady snared of her nobleness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever shamed or a captive pine.</p>
<h5>XII</h5>
<p class="poetry">When the South had voice of a nightingale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above a Maying bower,<br />
On the heights of Love walked radiant peers;<br />
The bird of the passion sang over his tears<br />

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Gracefullest</span> leaper,
the dappled fox-cub<br />
Curves over brambles with berries and buds,<br />
Light as a bubble that flies from the tub,<br />
Whisked by the laundry-wife out of her suds.<br />
Wavy he comes, woolly, all at his ease,<br />
Elegant, fashioned to foot with the deuce;<br />
Nature&rsquo;s own prince of the dance: then he sees<br />
Me, and retires as if making excuse.</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p class="poetry">Never closed minuet courtlier!&nbsp; Soon<br />
Cub-hunting troops were abroad, and a yelp<br />
Told of sure scent: ere the stroke upon noon<br />
Reynard the younger lay far beyond help.<br />
Wild, my poor friend, has the fate to be chased;<br />
Civil will conquer: were &rsquo;t other &rsquo;twere worse;<br />
Fair, by the flushed early morning embraced,<br />
Haply you live a day longer in verse.</p>

This clatterjaw his foot could set<br />

NUPTIALS OF ATTILA</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Flat</span> as to an
eagle&rsquo;s eye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Earth hung under Attila.<br />
Sign for carnage gave he none.<br />
In the peace of his disdain,<br />
Sun and rain, and rain and sun,<br />
Cherished men to wax again,<br />
Crawl, and in their manner die.<br />
On his people stood a frost.<br />
Like the charger cut in stone,<br />
Rearing stiff, the warrior host,<br />
Which had life from him alone,<br />
Craved the trumpet&rsquo;s eager note,<br />
As the bridled earth the Spring.<br />
Rusty was the trumpet&rsquo;s throat.<br />
He let chief and prophet rave;<br />
Venturous earth around him string<br />
Threads of grass and slender rye,<br />
Wave them, and untrampled wave.<br />
O for the time when God did cry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eye and have, my Attila!</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p class="poetry">Scorn of conquest filled like sleep<br />
Him that drank of havoc deep<br />
When the Green Cat pawed the globe:<br />
When the horsemen from his bow<br />
<a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>Shot in
sheaves and made the foe<br />
Crimson fringes of a robe,<br />
Trailed o&rsquo;er towns and fields in woe;<br />
When they streaked the rivers red,<br />
When the saddle was the bed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Attila, my Attila!</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p class="poetry">He breathed peace and pulled a flower.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eye and have, my Attila!<br />
This was the damsel Ildico,<br />
Rich in bloom until that hour:<br />
Shyer than the forest doe<br />
Twinkling slim through branches green.<br />
Yet the shyest shall be seen.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make the bed for Attila!</p>
<h4>IV</h4>
<p class="poetry">Seen of Attila, desired,<br />
She was led to him straightway:<br />
Radiantly was she attired;<br />
Rifled lands were her array,<br />
Jewels bled from weeping crowns,<br />
Gold of woeful fields and towns.<br />
She stood pallid in the light.<br />
How she walked, how withered white,<br />
From the blessing to the board,<br />
She who would have proudly blushed,<br />
Women whispered, asking why,<br />
Hinting of a youth, and hushed.<br />
Was it terror of her lord?<br />
Was she childish? was she sly?<br />
<a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>Was it
the bright mantle&rsquo;s dye<br />
Drained her blood to hues of grief<br />
Like the ash that shoots the spark?<br />
See the green tree all in leaf:<br />
See the green tree stripped of bark!&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make the bed for Attila!</p>
<h4>V</h4>
<p class="poetry">Round the banquet-table&rsquo;s load<br />
Scores of iron horsemen rode;<br />
Chosen warriors, keen and hard;<br />
Grain of threshing battle-dints;<br />
Attila&rsquo;s fierce body-guard,<br />
Smelling war like fire in flints.<br />
Grant them peace be fugitive!<br />
Iron-capped and iron-heeled,<br />
Each against his fellow&rsquo;s shield<br />
Smote the spear-head, shouting, Live,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Attila! my Attila!<br />
Eagle, eagle of our breed,<br />
Eagle, beak the lamb, and feed!<br />
Have her, and unleash us! live,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Attila! my Attila!</p>
<h4>VI</h4>
<p class="poetry">He was of the blood to shine<br />
Bronze in joy, like skies that scorch.<br />
Beaming with the goblet wine<br />
In the wavering of the torch,<br />
Looked he backward on his bride.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eye and have, my Attila!<br />
Fair in her wide robe was she:<br />
Where the robe and vest divide,<br />
<a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>Fair she
seemed surpassingly:<br />
Soft, yet vivid as the stream<br />
Danube rolls in the moonbeam<br />
Through rock-barriers: but she smiled<br />
Never, she sat cold as salt:<br />
Open-mouthed as a young child<br />
Wondering with a mind at fault.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make the bed for Attila!</p>
<h4>VII</h4>
<p class="poetry">Under the thin hoop of gold<br />
Whence in waves her hair outrolled,<br />
&rsquo;Twixt her brows the women saw<br />
Shadows of a vulture&rsquo;s claw<br />
Gript in flight: strange knots that sped<br />
Closing and dissolving aye:<br />
Such as wicked dreams betray<br />
When pale dawn creeps o&rsquo;er the bed.<br />
They might show the common pang<br />
Known to virgins, in whom dread<br />
Hunts their bliss like famished hounds;<br />
While the chiefs with roaring rounds<br />
Tossed her to her lord, and sang<br />
Praise of him whose hand was large,<br />
Cheers for beauty brought to yield,<br />
Chirrups of the trot afield,<br />
Hurrahs of the battle-charge.</p>
<h4>VIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">Those rock-faces hung with weed<br />
Reddened: their great days of speed,<br />
Slaughter, triumph, flood and flame,<br />
Like a jealous frenzy wrought,<br />
<a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>Scoffed
at them and did them shame,<br />
Quaffing idle, conquering nought.<br />
O for the time when God decreed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Earth the prey of Attila!<br />
God called on thee in his wrath,<br />
Trample it to mire!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas done.<br />
Swift as Danube clove our path<br />
Down from East to Western sun.<br />
Huns! behold your pasture, gaze,<br />
Take, our king said: heel to flank<br />
(Whisper it, the war-horse neighs!)<br />
Forth we drove, and blood we drank<br />
Fresh as dawn-dew: earth was ours:<br />
Men were flocks we lashed and spurned:<br />
Fast as windy flame devours,<br />
Flame along the wind, we burned.<br />
Arrow javelin, spear, and sword!<br />
Here the snows and there the plains;<br />
On! our signal: onward poured<br />
Torrents of the tightened reins,<br />
Foaming over vine and corn<br />
Hot against the city-wall.<br />
Whisper it, you sound a horn<br />
To the grey beast in the stall!<br />
Yea, he whinnies at a nod.<br />
O for sound of the trumpet-notes!<br />
O for the time when thunder-shod,<br />
He that scarce can munch his oats,<br />
Hung on the peaks, brooded aloof,<br />
Champed the grain of the wrath of God,<br />
Pressed a cloud on the cowering roof,<br />
Snorted out of the blackness fire!<br />
Scarlet broke the sky, and down,<br />
Hammering West with print of his hoof,<br />
He burst out of the bosom of ire<br />
<a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>Sharp as
eyelight under thy frown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Attila, my Attila!</p>
<h4>IX</h4>
<p class="poetry">Ravaged cities rolling smoke<br />
Thick on cornfields dry and black,<br />
Wave his banners, bear his yoke.<br />
Track the lightning, and you track<br />
Attila.&nbsp; They moan: &rsquo;tis he!<br />
Bleed: &rsquo;tis he!&nbsp; Beneath his foot<br />
Leagues are deserts charred and mute;<br />
Where he passed, there passed a sea.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Attila, my Attila!</p>
<h4>X</h4>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Who breathed on the king cold breath?<br

Said a voice amid the host,<br />
He is Death that weds a ghost,<br />
Else a ghost that weds with Death?<br />
Ildico&rsquo;s chill little hand<br />
Shuddering he beheld: austere<br />
Stared, as one who would command<br />
Sight of what has filled his ear:<br />
Plucked his thin beard, laughed disdain.<br />
Feast, ye Huns!&nbsp; His arm be raised,<br />
Like the warrior, battle-dazed,<br />
Joining to the fight amain.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make the bed for Attila!</p>
<h4>XI</h4>
<p class="poetry">Silent Ildico stood up.<br />
King and chief to pledge her well,<br />
Shocked sword sword and cup on cup,<br />
Clamouring like a brazen bell.<br />
<a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>Silent
stepped the queenly slave.<br />
Fair, by heaven! she was to meet<br />
On a midnight, near a grave,<br />
Flapping wide the winding-sheet.</p>
<h4>XII</h4>
<p class="poetry">Death and she walked through the crowd,<br />
Out beyond the flush of light.<br />
Ceremonious women bowed<br />
Following her: &rsquo;twas middle night.<br />
Then the warriors each on each<br />
Spied, nor overloudly laughed;<br />
Like the victims of the leech,<br />
Who have drunk of a strange draught.</p>
<h4>XIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">Attila remained.&nbsp; Even so<br />
Frowned he when he struck the blow,<br />
Brained his horse, that stumbled twice,<br />
On a bloody day in Gaul,<br />
Bellowing, Perish omens!&nbsp; All<br />
Marvelled at the sacrifice,<br />
But the battle, swinging dim,<br />
Rang off that axe-blow for him.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Attila, my Attila!</p>
<h4>XIV</h4>
<p class="poetry">Brightening over Danube wheeled<br />
Star by star; and she, most fair,<br />
Sweet as victory half-revealed,<br />
Seized to make him glad and young;<br />
She, O sweet as the dark sign<br />
<a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>Given
him oft in battles gone,<br />
When the voice within said, Dare!<br />
And the trumpet-notes were sprung<br />
Rapturous for the charge in line:<br />
She lay waiting: fair as dawn<br />
Wrapped in folds of night she lay;<br />
Secret, lustrous; flaglike there,<br />
Waiting him to stream and ray,<br />
With one loosening blush outflung,<br />
Colours of his hordes of horse<br />
Ranked for combat; still he hung<br />
Like the fever dreading air,<br />
Cursed of heat; and as a corse<br />
Gathers vultures, in his brain<br />
Images of her eyes and kiss<br />
Plucked at the limbs that could remain<br />
Loitering nigh the doors of bliss.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make the bed for Attila!</p>
<h4>XV</h4>
<p class="poetry">Passion on one hand, on one,<br />
Destiny led forth the Hun.<br />
Heard ye outcries of affright,<br />
Voices that through many a fray,<br />
In the press of flag and spear,<br />
Warned the king of peril near?<br />
Men were dumb, they gave him way,<br />
Eager heads to left and right,<br />
Like the bearded standard, thrust,<br />
As in battle, for a nod<br />
From their lord of battle-dust.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Attila, my Attila!<br />
Slow between the lines he trod.<br />
Saw ye not the sun drop slow<br />
<a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>On this
nuptial day, ere eve<br />
Pierced him on the couch aglow?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Attila, my Attila!<br />
Here and there his heart would cleave<br />
Clotted memory for a space:<br />
Some stout chief&rsquo;s familiar face,<br />
Choicest of his fighting brood,<br />
Touched him, as &rsquo;twere one to know<br />
Ere he met his bride&rsquo;s embrace.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Attila, my Attila!<br />
Twisting fingers in a beard<br />
Scant as winter underwood,<br />
With a narrowed eye he peered;<br />
Like the sunset&rsquo;s graver red<br />
Up old pine-stems.&nbsp; Grave he stood<br />
Eyeing them on whom was shed<br />
Burning light from him alone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Attila, my Attila!<br />
Red were they whose mouths recalled<br />
Where the slaughter mounted high,<br />
High on it, o&rsquo;er earth appalled,<br />
He; heaven&rsquo;s finger in their sight<br />
Raising him on waves of dead,<br />
Up to heaven his trumpets blown.<br />
O for the time when God&rsquo;s delight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crowned the head of Attila!<br />
Hungry river of the crag<br />
Stretching hands for earth he came:<br />
Force and Speed astride his name<br />
Pointed back to spear and flag.<br />
He came out of miracle cloud,<br />
Lightning-swift and spectre-lean.<br />
Now those days are in a shroud:<br />
Have him to his ghostly queen.<br />

<p class="poetry">One, with winecups overstrung,<br />
Cried him farewell in Rome&rsquo;s tongue.<br />
Who? for the great king turned as though<br />
Wrath to the shaft&rsquo;s head strained the bow.<br />
Nay, not wrath the king possessed,<br />
But a radiance of the breast.<br />
In that sound he had the key<br />
Of his cunning malady.<br />
Lo, where gleamed the sapphire lake,<br />
Leo, with his Rome at stake,<br />
Drew blank air to hues and forms;<br />
Whereof Two that shone distinct,<br />
Linked as orbed stars are linked,<br />
Clear among the myriad swarms,<br />
In a constellation, dashed<br />
Full on horse and rider&rsquo;s eyes<br />
Sunless light, but light it was&mdash;<br />
Light that blinded and abashed,<br />
Froze his members, bade him pause,<br />
Caught him mid-gallop, blazed him home.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Attila, my Attila!<br />
What are streams that cease to flow?<br />
What was Attila, rolled thence,<br />
Cheated by a juggler&rsquo;s show?<br />
Like that lake of blue intense,<br />
Under tempest lashed to foam,<br />
Lurid radiance, as he passed,<br />
Filled him, and around was glassed,<br />
When deep-voiced he uttered, Rome!</p>

Sworn it by his naked life!<br />
Eagle, snakes these women are:<br />
Take them on the wing! but war,<br />
Smoking war&rsquo;s the warrior&rsquo;s wife!<br />

Down the hillspurs, out of tents<br />
Glimmering in mid-forest, through<br />
Mists of the cool morning scents,<br />
Forth from city-alley, court,<br />
Arch, the bounding horsemen flew,<br />
Joined along the plains of dew,<br />
Raced and gave the rein to sport,<br />
Closed and streamed like curtain-rents<br />
Fluttered by a wind, and flowed<br />
Into squadrons: trumpets blew,<br />

Ready to be hurled at need<br />

Ho, the little wanton fool!<br />
We were his before she squealed<br />
Blind for mother&rsquo;s milk, and heeled<br />
Kicking on her mother&rsquo;s knee.<br />
His in life and death are we:<br />
She but one flower of a field.<br />

Floes to bergs, and giant peers<br />
Wrestle on a drifted isle;<br />
Island on ice-island rears;<br />
Dissolution battles fast:<br />
Big the senseless Titans loom,<br />
Through a mist of common doom<br />
Striving which shall die the last:<br />
Till a gentle-breathing morn<br />
Frees the stream from bank to bank.<br />
So the Empire built of scorn<br />
Agonized, dissolved and sank.<br />
Of the Queen no more was told<br />
Than of leaf on Danube rolled.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make the bed for Attila!</p>

<h4>I</h4>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Prince</span> of Bards was
old Aneurin;<br />
He the grand Gododin sang;<br />
All his numbers threw such fire in,<br />
Struck his harp so wild a twang;&mdash;<br />
Still the wakeful Briton borrows<br />
Wisdom from its ancient heat:<br />
Still it haunts our source of sorrows,<br />
Deep excess of liquor sweet!</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p class="poetry">Here the Briton, there the Saxon,<br />
Face to face, three fields apart,<br />
Thirst for light to lay their thwacks on<br />
Each the other with good heart.<br />
Dry the Saxon sits, &rsquo;mid dinful<br />
Noise of iron knits his steel:<br />
Fresh and roaring with a skinful,<br />
Britons round the hirlas reel.</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p class="poetry">Yellow flamed the meady sunset;<br />
Red runs up the flag of morn.<br />
Signal for the British onset<br />
Hiccups through the British horn.<br />

these hillmen pour like cattle<br />
Sniffing pasture: grim below,<br />
Showing eager teeth of battle,<br />
In his spear-heads lies the foe.</p>

Back into his hungry brine.<br />
&mdash;You shall lodge him, feed him, wive him,<br />
Look on us; we stand in line.<br />
&mdash;Pale sea-monster! foul the waters<br />
Cast him; foul he leaves our land.<br />
&mdash;You shall yield us land and daughters:<br />
Stay the tongue, and try the hand.</p>
<h4>V</h4>
<p class="poetry">Swift as torrent-streams our warriors,<br />
Tossing torrent lights, find way;<br />
Burst the ridges, crowd the barriers,<br />
Pierce them where the spear-heads play;<br />
Turn them as the clods in furrow,<br />
Top them like the leaping foam;<br />
Sorrow to the mother, sorrow,<br />
Sorrow to the wife at home!</p>
<h4>VI</h4>
<p class="poetry">Stags, they butted; bulls, they bellowed;<br />
Hounds, we baited them; oh, brave!<br />
Every second man, unfellowed,<br />
Took the strokes of two, and gave.<br />
Bare as hop-stakes in November&rsquo;s<br />
Mists they met our battle-flood:<br />
Hoary-red as Winter&rsquo;s embers<br />
Lay their dead lines done in blood.</p>

<p class="poetry">Thou, my Bard, didst hang thy lyre in<br />
Oak-leaves, and with crimson brand<br />
Rhythmic fury spent, Aneurin;<br />
Songs the churls could understand:<br />
Thrumming on their Saxon sconces<br />
Straight, the invariable blow,<br />
Till they snorted true responses.<br />
Ever thus the Bard they know!</p>
<h4>VIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">But ere nightfall, harper lusty!<br />
When the sun was like a ball<br />
Dropping on the battle dusty,<br />
What was yon discordant call?<br />
Cambria&rsquo;s old metheglin demon<br />
Breathed against our rushing tide;<br />
Clove us midst the threshing seamen:&mdash;<br />
Gashed, we saw our ranks divide!</p>
<h4>IX</h4>
<p class="poetry">Britain then with valedictory<br />
Shriek veiled off her face and knelt.<br />
Full of liquor, full of victory,<br />
Chief on chief old vengeance dealt.<br />
Backward swung their hurly-burly;<br />
None but dead men kept the fight.<br />
They that drink their cup too early,<br />
Darkness they shall see ere night.</p>
<h4>X</h4>
<p class="poetry">Loud we heard the yellow rover<br />

Marched into the bloody dawn.</p>

<p class="poetry">Day on day we fought, though shattered:<br />
Pushed and met repulses sharp,<br />
Till our Raven&rsquo;s plumes were scattered:<br />
All, save old Aneurin&rsquo;s harp.<br />
Hear it wailing like a mother<br />
O&rsquo;er the strings of children slain!<br />
He in one tongue, in another,<br />
Alien, I; one blood, yet twain.</p>
<h4>XII</h4>
<p class="poetry">Old Aneurin! droop no longer.<br />
That squat ocean-scum, we own,<br />
Had fine stoutness, made us stronger,<br />
Brought us much-required backbone:<br />
Claimed of Power their dues, and granted<br />
Dues to Power in turn, when rose<br />
Mightier rovers; they that planted<br />
Sovereign here the Norman nose.</p>
<h4>XIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">Glorious men, with heads of eagles,<br />
Chopping arms, and cupboard lips;<br />
Warriors, hunters, keen as beagles,<br />
Mounted aye on horse or ships.<br />
Active, being hungry creatures;<br />
Silent, having nought to say:<br />
High they raised the lord of features,<br />
Saxon-worshipped to this day.</p>

<p class="poetry">Hear its deeds, the great recital!<br />
Stout as bergs of Arctic ice<br />
Once it led, and lived; a title<br />
Now it is, and names its price.<br />
This our Saxon brothers cherish:<br />
This, when by the worth of wits<br />
Lands are reared aloft, or perish,<br />
Sole illumes their lucre-pits.</p>
<h4>XV</h4>
<p class="poetry">Know we not our wrongs, unwritten<br />
Though they be, Aneurin?&nbsp; Sword,<br />
Song, and subtle mind, the Briton<br />
Brings to market, all ignored.<br />
&rsquo;Gainst the Saxon&rsquo;s bone impinging,<br />
Still is our Gododin played;<br />
Shamed we see him humbly cringing<br />
In a shadowy nose&rsquo;s shade.</p>
<h4>XVI</h4>
<p class="poetry">Bitter is the weight that crushes<br />
Low, my Bard, thy race of fire.<br />
Here no fair young future blushes<br />
Bridal to a man&rsquo;s desire.<br />
Neither chief, nor aim, nor splendour<br />
Dressing distance, we perceive.<br />
Neither honour, nor the tender<br />
Bloom of promise, morn or eve.</p>
<h4>XVII</h4>
<p class="poetry">Joined we are; a tide of races<br />
Rolled to meet a common fate;<br />

Thumps with pride as Mammon&rsquo;s wife;<br />

<h4>XVIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">O my Bard! a yellow liquor,<br />
Like to that we drank of old&mdash;<br />
Gold is her metheglin beaker,<br />
She destruction drinks in gold.<br />
Warn her, Bard, that Power is pressing<br />
Hotly for his dues this hour;<br />
Tell her that no drunken blessing<br />
Stops the onward march of Power.</p>
<h4>XIX</h4>
<p class="poetry">Has she ears to take forewarnings<br />
She will cleanse her of her stains,<br />
Feed and speed for braver mornings<br />
Valorously the growth of brains.<br />
Power, the hard man knit for action,<br />
Reads each nation on the brow.<br />
Cripple, fool, and petrifaction<br />
Fall to him&mdash;are falling now!</p>

Her son, because his brows were black of her,<br />
Runs barking for his bread, a fugitive,<br />
And Corinth frowns on them that feed the cur.</p>

Of Corinth, high Periander; the superb<br />
In magnanimity, in rule severe.<br />
Up on his marble fortress-tower he sits,<br />
The city under him: a white yoked steer,<br />
That bears his heart for pulse, his head for wits.</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p class="poetry">Bloom of the generous fires of his fair
Spring<br />
Still coloured him when men forbore to sting;<br />
Admiring meekly where the ordered seeds<br />

At whiles a crouching dog, on him all eye.</p>

Impelled him to the path of Lycophron.</p>

A figure shunned along the busy quay,<br />

Bubbles at prow and foam along the wake.<br />

Shall be known even as when <i>I</i> strike on the string&rsquo;d
shell with melody,<br />
And the golden notes, like medicine, darting straight to the
cavities,<br />
Fill them up, till hearts of men bound as the billows, the ships
thereon.&rsquo;<br />
Thus intently urged the Sun-God; but the force of his
eloquence<br />
Was the pressing on of sea-waves scattered broad from the rocks
away.<br />
What shall move a soul from madness?&nbsp; Lost, lost in
delirium,<br />
Rock-fast, the adolescent to his father, irreverent,<br />
&lsquo;By the oath! the oath! thine oath!&rsquo; cried.&nbsp; The
effulgent forese&euml;r then,<br />
Quivering in his loins parental, on the boy&rsquo;s beaming
countenance<br />
Looked and moaned, and urged him for love&rsquo;s sake, for sweet
life&rsquo;s sake, to yield the claim,<br />
<a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>To
abandon his mad hunger, and avert the calamity.<br />
But he, vehement, passionate, called out: &lsquo;Let me show I am
what I say,<br />
That the taunts I hear be silenced: I am stung with their
whispering.<br />
Only, Thou, my Father, Thou tell how aloft the revolving
wheels,<br />
How aloft the cleaving horse-crests I may guide peremptorily,<br
/>
Till I drink the shadows, fire-hot, like a flower celestial,<br
/>
And my fellows see me curbing the fierce steeds, the dear
dew-drinkers:<br />
Yea, for this I gaze on life&rsquo;s light; throw for this any
sacrifice.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">All the end foreseeing, Phoebus to his oath
irrevocable<br />
Bowed obedient, deploring the insanity pitiless.<br />
Then the flame-outsnorting horses were led forth: it was so
decreed.<br />
They were yoked before the glad youth by his
sister-ancillaries.<br />
Swift the ripple ripples follow&rsquo;d, as of aureate
Helicon,<br />
Down their flanks, while they impatient pawed desire of the
distances,<br />
And the bit with fury champed.&nbsp; Oh! unimaginable delight!<br
/>
Unimagined speed and splendour in the circle of upper air!<br />
Glory grander than the armed host upon earth singing victory!<br
/>
Chafed the youth with their spirit s&uacute;rcharged, as when
blossom is shaken by winds,<br />
Marked that labour by his sister Phaethontiades finished,
quick<br />
On the slope of the car his forefoot set assured: and the morning
rose:<br />
<a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>Seeing
whom, and what a day dawned, stood the God, as in harvest
fields,<br />
When the reaper grasps the full sheaf and the sickle that severs
it:<br />
Hugged the withered head with one hand, with the other, to
indicate<br />
(If this woe might be averted, this immeasurable evil),<br />
Laid the kindling course in view, told how the reins to
manipulate:<br />
Named the horses fondly, fearful, caution&rsquo;d urgently
betweenwhiles:<br />
Their diverging tempers dwelt on, and their wantonness,
wickedness,<br />
That the voice of Gods alone held in restraint; but the voice of
Gods;<br />
None but Gods can curb.&nbsp; He spake: vain were the words:
scarcely listening,<br />
Mounted Phaethon, swinging reins loose, and, &lsquo;Behold me,
companions,<br />
It is I here, I!&rsquo; he shouted, glancing down with
supremacy;<br />
&lsquo;Not to any of you was this gift granted ever in annals of
men;<br />
I alone what only Gods can, I alone am governing day!&rsquo;<br
/>
Short the triumph, brief his rapture: see a hurricane suddenly<br
/>
Beat the lifting billow crestless, roll it broken this way and
that;&mdash;<br />
At the leap on yielding ether, in despite of his reprimand,<br />
Swayed tumultuous the fire-steeds, plunging reckless hither and
yon;<br />
Unto men a great amazement, all agaze at the Troubled
East:&mdash;<br />
Pitifully for mastery striving in ascension, the charioteer,<br
/>
<a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>Reminiscent, drifts of counsel caught confused in his
arid wits;<br />
The reins stiff ahind his shoulder madly pulled for the
mastery,<br />
Till a thunder off the tense chords thro&rsquo; his ears
dinn&egrave;d horrible.<br />
Panic seized him: fled his vision of inviolability;<br />
Fled the dream that he of mortals rode mischances predominant;<br
/>
And he cried, &lsquo;Had I petitioned for a cup of chill
aconite,<br />
My descent to awful Hades had been soft, for now must I go<br />
With the curse by father Zeus cast on ambition immoderate.<br />
Oh, my sisters!&nbsp; Thou, my Goddess, in whose love I was
enviable,<br />
From whose arms I rushed befrenzied, what a wreck will this body
be,<br />
That admired of thee stood rose-warm in the courts where thy
mysteries<br />
Celebration had from me, me the most splendidly privileged!<br />
Never more shall I thy temple fill with incenses bewildering;<br
/>
Not again hear thy half-murmurs&mdash;I am lost!&mdash;never,
never more.<br />
I am wrecked on seas of air, hurled to my death in a vessel of
flame!<br />
Hither, sisters!&nbsp; Father, save me!&nbsp; Hither, succour me,
Cypria!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Now a wail of men to Zeus rang: from Olympus
the Thunderer<br />
Saw the rage of the havoc wide-mouthed, the bright car
superimpending<br />
<a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>Over
Asia, Africa, low down; ruin flaming over the vales;<br />
Light disastrous rising savage out of smoke inveterately;<br />
Beast-black, conflagration like a menacing shadow move<br />
With voracious roaring southward, where aslant, insufferable,<br
/>
The bright steeds careered their parched way down an arc of the
firmament.<br />
For the day grew like to thick night, and the orb was its
beacon-fire,<br />
And from hill to hill of darkness burst the day&rsquo;s
apparition forth.<br />
Lo, a wrestler, not a God, stood in the chariot ever lowering:<br
/>
Lo, the shape of one who raced there to outstrip the legitimate
hours:<br />
Lo, the ravish&rsquo;d beams of Phoebus dragged in shame at the
chariot-wheels:<br />
Light of days of happy pipings by the mead-singing rivulets!<br
/>
Lo, lo, increasing lustre, torrid breath to the nostrils; lo,<br

Torrid brilliancies thro&rsquo; the vapours lighten swifter,
penetrate them,<br />
Fasten merciless, ruminant, hueless, on earth&rsquo;s frame
crackling busily.<br />
He aloft, the frenzied driver, in the glow of the universe,<br />
Like the paling of the dawn-star withers visibly, he aloft:<br />
Bitter fury in his aspect, bitter death in the heart of him.<br
/>
Crouch the herds, contract the reptiles, crouch the lions under
their paws.<br />
White as metal in the furnace are the faces of human-kind:<br />
Inarticulate creatures of earth dumb all await the ultimate
shock.<br />
<a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>To the
bolt he launched, &lsquo;Strike dead, thou,&rsquo; uttered Zeus,
very terrible;<br />
&lsquo;Perish folly, else &rsquo;tis man&rsquo;s fate&rsquo;; and
the bolt flew unerringly.<br />
Then the kindler stooped; from the torch-car down the measureless
altitudes<br />
Leaned his rayless head, relinquished rein and footing, raised
not a cry.<br />
Like the flower on the river&rsquo;s surface when expanding it
vanishes,<br />
Gave his limbs to right and left, quenched: and so fell he
precipitate,<br />
Seen of men as a glad rain-fall, sending coolness yet ere it
comes:<br />
So he showered above them, shadowed o&rsquo;er the blue
archipelagoes,<br />
O&rsquo;er the silken-shining pastures of the continents and the
isles;<br />
So descending brought revival to the greenery of our earth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lither, noisy in the breezes now his sisters
shivering weep,<br />
By the river flowing smooth out to the vexed sea of Adria,<br />
Where he fell, and where they suffered sudden change to the
tremulous<br />
Ever-wailful trees bemoaning him, a bruised purple cyclamen.</p>

Swift up the run of turf it speeds,<br />

Her music!&nbsp; Beauteous was she seen<br />
Beneath her midway West of South;<br />
And sister was her quivered green<br />
To sapphire of the Nereid eyes<br />
On sea when sun is breeze; she winked<br />
As they, and waved, heaved waterwise<br />
Her flood of leaves and grasses linked:<br />
A myriad lustrous butterflies<br />
A moment in the fluttering sheen;<br />
Becapped with the slate air that throws<br />
The reindeer&rsquo;s antlers black between<br />

APPEASEMENT OF DEMETER</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Demeter</span> devastated
our good land,<br />
In blackness for her daughter snatched below.<br />
Smoke-pillar or loose hillock was the sand,<br />
Where soil had been to clasp warm seed and throw<br />
The wheat, vine, olive, ripe to Summer&rsquo;s ray.<br />
Now whether night advancing, whether day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarce did the
baldness show:<br />
The hand of man was a defeated hand.</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p class="poetry">Necessity, the primal goad to growth,<br />
Stood shrunken; Youth and Age appeared as one;<br />
Like Winter Summer; good as labour sloth;<br />
Nor was there answer wherefore beamed the sun,<br />
Or why men drew the breath to carry pain.<br />
High reared the ploughshare, broken lay the wain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Idly the
flax-wheel spun<br />
Unridered: starving lords were wasp and moth.</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p class="poetry">Lean grassblades losing green on their bent
flags,<br />
Sang chilly to themselves; lone honey-bees<br />
Pursued the flowers that were not with dry bags;<br />
Sole sound aloud the snap of sapless trees,<br />
<a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>More
sharp than slingstones on hard breastplates hurled.<br />
Back to first chaos tumbled the stopped world,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Careless to lure
or please.<br />
A nature of gaunt ribs, an earth of crags.</p>
<h4>IV</h4>
<p class="poetry">No smile Demeter cast: the gloom she saw,<br />
Well draped her direful musing; for in gloom,<br />
In thicker gloom, deep down the cavern-maw,<br />
Her sweet had vanished; liker unto whom,<br />
And whose pale place of habitation mute,<br />
She and all seemed where Seasons, pledged for fruit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anciently, gaped
for bloom:<br />
Where hand of man was as a plucked fowl&rsquo;s claw.</p>
<h4>V</h4>
<p class="poetry">The wrathful Queen descended on a vale,<br />
That ere the ravished hour for richness heaved.<br />
Iambe, maiden of the merry tale,<br />
Beside her eyed the once red-cheeked, green-leaved.<br />
It looked as if the Deluge had withdrawn.<br />
Pity caught at her throat; her jests were gone.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than for
her who grieved,<br />
She could for this waste home have piped the wail.</p>
<h4>VI</h4>
<p class="poetry">Iambe, her dear mountain-rivulet<br />
To waken laughter from cold stones, beheld<br />
A riven wheatfield cracking for the wet,<br />
And seed like infant&rsquo;s teeth, that never swelled,<br />
Apeep up flinty ridges, milkless round.<br />
Teeth of the giants marked she where thin ground<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rocky in spikes
rebelled<br />
Against the hand here slack as rotted net.</p>

<p class="poetry">The valley people up the ashen scoop<br />
She beckoned, aiming hopelessly to win<br />
Her Mistress in compassion of yon group<br />
So pinched and wizened; with their aged grin,<br />
For lack of warmth to smile on mouths of woe,<br />
White as in chalk outlining little O,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dumb, from a
falling chin;<br />
Young, old, alike half-bent to make the hoop.</p>
<h4>VIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">Their tongues of birds they wagged, weak-voiced
as when<br />
Dark underwaters the recesses choke;<br />
With cluck and upper quiver of a hen<br />
In grasp, past peeking: cry before the croak.<br />
Relentlessly their gold-haired Heaven, their fount<br />
Bountiful of old days, heard them recount<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This and that
cruel stroke:<br />
Nor eye nor ear had she for piteous men.</p>
<h4>IX</h4>
<p class="poetry">A figure of black rock by sunbeams crowned<br
/>
Through stormclouds, where the volumed shades enfold<br />
An earth in awe before the claps resound<br />
And woods and dwellings are as billows rolled,<br />
The barren Nourisher unmelted shed<br />
Death from the looks that wandered with the dead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the
realms of gold,<br />
In famine for her lost, her lost unfound.</p>
<h4>X</h4>
<p class="poetry">Iambe from her Mistress tripped; she raised<br

The cattle-call above the moan of prayer;<br />
And slowly out of fields their fancy grazed,<br />
Among the droves, defiled a horse and mare:<br />

They nodded, and Demeter on them gazed.</p>
<h4>XI</h4>
<p class="poetry">Howbeit the season of the dancing blood,<br />
Forgot was horse of mare, yea, mare of horse:<br />
Reversed, each head at either&rsquo;s flank, they stood.<br />
Whereat the Goddess, in a dim remorse,<br />
Laid hand on them, and smacked; and her touch pricked.<br />
Neighing within, at either&rsquo;s flank they licked;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Played on a
moment&rsquo;s force<br />
At courtship, withering to the crazy nod.</p>
<h4>XII</h4>
<p class="poetry">The nod was that we gather for consent;<br />
And mournfully amid the group a dame,<br />
Interpreting the thing in nature meant,<br />
Her hands held out like bearers of the flame,<br />
And nodded for the negative sideways.<br />
Keen at her Mistress glanced Iambe: rays<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Great
Mother came:<br />
Her lips were opened wide; the curse was rent.</p>
<h4>XIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">She laughed: since our first harvesting heard
none<br />
Like thunder of the song of heart: her face,<br />
The dreadful darkness, shook to mounted sun,<br />
And peal on peal across the hills held chase.<br />
She laughed herself to water; laughed to fire;<br />
Laughed the torrential laugh of dam and sire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full of the
marrowy race.<br />
Her laughter, Gods! was flesh on skeleton.</p>

<p class="poetry">The valley people huddled, broke, afraid,<br />
Assured, and taking lightning in the veins,<br />
They puffed, they leaped, linked hands, together swayed,<br />
Unwitting happiness till golden rains<br />
Of tears in laughter, laughter weeping, smote<br />
Knowledge of milky mercy from that throat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pouring to heal
their pains:<br />
And one bold youth set mouth at a shy maid.</p>
<h4>XV</h4>
<p class="poetry">Iambe clapped to see the kindly lusts<br />
Inspire the valley people, still on seas,<br />
Like poplar-tops relieved from stress of gusts,<br />
With rapture in their wonderment; but these,<br />
Low homage being rendered, ran to plough,<br />
Fed by the laugh, as by the mother cow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calves at the
teats they tease:<br />
Soon drove they through the yielding furrow-crusts.</p>
<h4>XVI</h4>
<p class="poetry">Uprose the blade in green, the leaf in red,<br

The tree of water and the tree of wood:<br />
And soon among the branches overhead<br />
Gave beauty juicy issue sweet for food.<br />
O Laughter! beauty plumped and love had birth.<br />
Laughter!&nbsp; O thou reviver of sick Earth!<br />

Of dust whirls, dropping lumped: near thunder speaks,<br />

Ere the children had entered my gate<br />
With their wreaths and mechanical lay,<br />
A metal ding-dong of the date!<br />
I mounted our hill, bearing heart<br />
That had little of life save its weight:<br />
The crowned Shadow poising dart<br />
Hung over her: she, my own,<br />
My good companion, mate,<br />
Pulse of me: she who had shown<br />
Fortitude quiet as Earth&rsquo;s<br />
At the shedding of leaves.&nbsp; And around<br />
The sky was in garlands of cloud,<br />
Winning scents from unnumbered new births,<br />
Pointed buds, where the woods were browned<br />
By a mouldered beechen shroud;<br />
Or over our meads of the vale,<br />
Such an answer to sun as he,<br />
Brave in his gold; to a sound,<br />
None sweeter, of woods flapping sail,<br />
With the first full flood of our year,<br />
For their voyage on lustreful sea:<br />
Unto what curtained haven in chief,<br />
Will be writ in the book of the sere.<br />
But surely the crew are we,<br />
Eager or stamped or bowed;<br />
Counted thinner at fall of the leaf.<br />

In volumes of foliage proud,<br />

Rattles thunder a boat overrides.<br />

The worm drew its links from the turf;<br />
The bird of felicity loud<br />
Spun high, and a South wind blew.<br />
Weak out of sheath downy leaves<br />
Of the beech quivered lucid as dew,<br />
Their radiance asking, who grieves;<br />
For nought of a sorrow they knew:<br />
No space to the dread wrestle vowed,<br />
No chamber in shadow of night.<br />
At times as the steadier breeze<br />
Flutter-huddled their twigs to a crowd,<br />
The beam of them wafted my sight<br />
To league-long sun upon seas:<br />
The golden path we had crossed<br />
Many years, till her birthland swung<br />
Recovered to vision from lost,<br />
A light in her filial glance.<br />
And sweet was her voice with the tongue,<br />
The speechful tongue of her France,<br />
Soon at ripple about us, like rills<br />
Ever busy with little: away<br />
Through her Normandy, down where the mills<br />
Dot at lengths a rivercourse, grey<br />

To gusts off the plains above.<br />

Shuttle or needle, and woo<br />

Frogging each mud-walled cot.<br />

The jawed wolf-waters of prey.<br />
We stand upon isles, who stand:<br />
A Shadow before us, and back,<br />
A phantom the habited land.<br />
We may cry to the Sunderer, spare<br />
That dearest! he loosens his pack.<br />
Arrows we breathe, not air.<br />
The memories tenderly bound<br />
To us are a drifting crew,<br />
<a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>Amid
grey-gapped waters for ground.<br />
Alone do we stand, each one,<br />
Till rootless as they we strew<br />
Those deeps of the corse-like stare<br />
At a foreign and stony sun.</p>
<p class="poetry">Eyes had I but for the scene<br />
Of my circle, what neighbourly grew.<br />
If haply no finger lay out<br />
To the figures of days that had been,<br />
I gathered my herb, and endured;<br />
My old cloak wrapped me about.<br />
Unfooted was ground-ivy blue,<br />
Whose rustic shrewd odour allured<br />
In Spring&rsquo;s fresh of morning: unseen<br />
Her favourite wood-sorrel bell<br />
As yet, though the leaves&rsquo; green floor<br />
Awaited their flower, that would tell<br />
Of a red-veined moist yestreen,<br />
With its droop and the hues it wore,<br />
When we two stood overnight<br />
One, in the dark van-glow<br />
On our hill-top, seeing beneath<br />
Our household&rsquo;s twinkle of light<br />
Through spruce-boughs, gem of a wreath.</p>
<p class="poetry">Budding, the service-tree, white<br />
Almost as whitebeam, threw,<br />
From the under of leaf upright,<br />
Flecks like a showering snow<br />
On the flame-shaped junipers green,<br />
On the sombre mounds of the yew.<br />
Like silvery tapers bright<br />
By a solemn cathedral screen,<br />
They glistened to closer view.<br />
<a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>Turf for
a rooks&rsquo; revel striped<br />
Pleased those devourers astute.<br />
Chorister blackbird and thrush<br />
Together or alternate piped;<br />
A free-hearted harmony large,<br />
With meaning for man, for brute,<br />
When the primitive forces are brimmed.<br />
Like featherings hither and yon<br />
Of a&euml;ry tree-twigs over marge,<br />
To the comb of the winds, untrimmed,<br />
Their measure is found in the vast.<br />
Grief heard them, and stepped her way on.<br />
She has but a narrow embrace.<br />
Distrustful of hearing she passed.<br />
They piped her young Earth&rsquo;s Bacchic rout;<br />
The race, and the prize of the race;<br />
Earth&rsquo;s lustihead pressing to sprout.</p>
<p class="poetry">But sight holds a soberer space.<br />
Colourless dogwood low<br />
Curled up a twisted root,<br />
Nigh yellow-green mosses, to flush<br />
Redder than sun upon rocks,<br />
When the creeper clematis-shoot<br />
Shall climb, cap his branches, and show,<br />
Beside veteran green of the box,<br />
At close of the year&rsquo;s maple blush,<br />
A bleeding greybeard is he,<br />
Now hale in the leafage lush.<br />
Our parasites paint us.&nbsp; Hard by,<br />
A wet yew-trunk flashed the peel<br />
Of our naked forefathers in fight;<br />
With stains of the fray sweating free;<br />
And him came no parasite nigh:<br />
Firm on the hard knotted knee,<br />
<a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>He stood
in the crown of his dun;<br />
Earth&rsquo;s toughest to stay her wheel:<br />

Whom the century-tempests call son,<br />
Having striven to rend him in vain.</p>
<p class="poetry">I walked to observe, not to feel,<br />
Not to fancy, if simple of eye<br />
One may be among images reaped<br />
For a shift of the glance, as grain:<br />
Profitless froth you espy<br />
Ashore after billows have leaped.<br />
I fled nothing, nothing pursued:<br />
The changeful visible face<br />
Of our Mother I sought for my food;<br />
Crumbs by the way to sustain.<br />
Her sentence I knew past grace.<br />
Myself I had lost of us twain,<br />
Once bound in mirroring thought.<br />
She had flung me to dust in her wake;<br />
And I, as your convict drags<br />
His chain, by the scourge untaught,<br />
Bore life for a goad, without aim.<br />
I champed the sensations that make<br />
Of a ruffled philosophy rags.<br />
For them was no meaning too blunt,<br />
Nor aspect too cutting of steel.<br />
This Earth of the beautiful breasts,<br />
Shining up in all colours aflame,<br />
To them had visage of hags:<br />
A Mother of aches and jests:<br />
Soulless, heading a hunt<br />
Aimless except for the meal.<br />
Hope, with the star on her front;<br />
Fear, with an eye in the heel;<br />
<a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>Our
links to a Mother of grace;<br />
They were dead on the nerve, and dead<br />
For the nature divided in three;<br />
Gone out of heart, out of brain,<br />
Out of soul: I had in their place<br />
The calm of an empty room.<br />
We were joined but by that thin thread,<br />
My disciplined habit to see.<br />
And those conjure images, those,<br />
The puppets of loss or gain;<br />
Not he who is bare to his doom;<br />
For whom never semblance plays<br />
To bewitch, overcloud, illume.<br />
The dusty mote-images rose;<br />
Sheer film of the surface awag:<br />
They sank as they rose; their pain<br />
Declaring them mine of old days.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now gazed I where, sole upon gloom,<br />
As flower-bush in sun-specked crag,<br />
Up the spine of the double combe<br />
With yew-boughs heavily cloaked,<br />
A young apparition shone:<br />
Known, yet wonderful, white<br />
Surpassingly; doubtfully known,<br />
For it struck as the birth of Light:<br />
Even Day from the dark unyoked.<br />
It waved like a pilgrim flag<br />
O&rsquo;er processional penitents flown<br />
When of old they broke rounding yon spine:<br />
O the pure wild-cherry in bloom!</p>
<p class="poetry">For their Eastward march to the shrine<br />
Of the footsore far-eyed Faith,<br />
Was banner so brave, so fair,<br />
So quick with celestial sign<br />

To illumine the sinister field<br />
Where our life&rsquo;s old night-bird flits.<br />
I knew it: with her, my own,<br />
Had hailed it pure of the pure;<br />
Our beacon yearly: but strange<br />
When it strikes to within is the known;<br />
Richer than newness revealed.<br />
There was needed darkness like mine.<br />
Its beauty to vividness blown<br />
Drew the life in me forward, chased,<br />
From aloft on a pinnacle&rsquo;s range,<br />
That hindward spidery line,<br />
The length of the ways I had paced,<br />
A footfarer out of the dawn,<br />
To Youth&rsquo;s wild forest, where sprang,<br />
For the morning of May long gone,<br />
The forest&rsquo;s white virgin; she<br />
Seen yonder; and sheltered me, sang;<br />
She in me, I in her; what songs<br />
The fawn-eared wood-hollows revive<br />
To pour forth their tune-footed throngs;<br />
Inspire to the dreaming of good<br />
Illimitable to come:<br />
She, the white wild cherry, a tree,<br />
Earth-rooted, tangibly wood,<br />
Yet a presence throbbing alive;<br />
Nor she in our language dumb:<br />
A spirit born of a tree;<br />
Because earth-rooted alive:<br />
Huntress of things worth pursuit<br />
<a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>Of
souls; in our naming, dreams.<br />
And each unto other was lute,<br />
By fits quick as breezy gleams.<br />
My quiver of aims and desires<br />
Had colour that she would have owned;<br />
And if by humaner fires<br />
Hued later, these held her enthroned:<br />
My crescent of Earth; my blood<br />
At the silvery early stir;<br />
Hour of the thrill of the bud<br />
About to burst, and by her<br />
Directed, attuned, englobed:<br />
My Goddess, the chaste, not chill;<br />
Choir over choir white-robed;<br />
White-bosomed fold within fold:<br />
For so could I dream, breast-bare,<br />
In my time of blooming; dream still<br />
Through the maze, the mesh, and the wreck,<br />
Despite, since manhood was bold,<br />
The yoke of the flesh on my neck.<br />
She beckoned, I gazed, unaware<br />
How a shaft of the blossoming tree<br />
Was shot from the yew-wood&rsquo;s core.<br />
I stood to the touch of a key<br />
Turned in a fast-shut door.</p>
<p class="poetry">They rounded my garden, content,<br />
The small fry, clutching their fee,<br />
Their fruit of the wreath and the pole;<br />
And, chatter, hop, skip, they were sent,<br />
In a buzz of young company glee,<br />
Their natural music, swift shoal<br />
To the next easy shedders of pence.<br />
Why not? for they had me in tune<br />
With the hungers of my kind.<br />

I had with the peace within;<br />
Or patience, mortal of peace,<br />
Compressing the surgent strife<br />
In a heart laid open, not mailed,<br />
To the last blank hour of the rack,<br />

When the hand that never had failed<br />
In its pressure to mine hung slack.</p>

Believing the vision divine,<br />
Wings of that dream of my Youth<br />

<p class="poetry">Shall man into the mystery of breath,<br />
From his quick beating pulse a pathway spy?<br />
Or learn the secret of the shrouded death,<br />
By lifting up the lid of a white eye?<br />
Cleave thou thy way with fathering desire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of fire to reach
to fire.</p>
<h4>VI</h4>
<p class="poetry">Look now where Colour, the soul&rsquo;s
bridegroom, makes<br />
The house of heaven splendid for the bride.<br />
To him as leaps a fountain she awakes,<br />
In knotting arms, yet boundless: him beside,<br />
She holds the flower to heaven, and by his power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brings heaven to
the flower.</p>
<h4>VII</h4>
<p class="poetry">He gives her homeliness in desert air,<br />
And sovereignty in spaciousness; he leads<br />
Through widening chambers of surprise to where<br />
Throbs rapture near an end that aye recedes,<br />
Because his touch is infinite and lends<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A yonder to all
ends.</p>
<h4><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>VIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">Death begs of Life his blush; Life Death
persuades<br />
To keep long day with his caresses graced.<br />
He is the heart of light, the wing of shades,<br />
The crown of beauty: never soul embraced<br />
Of him can harbour unfaith; soul of him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Possessed walks
never dim.</p>
<h4>IX</h4>
<p class="poetry">Love eyed his rosy memories: he sang:<br />
O bloom of dawn, breathed up from the gold sheaf<br />
Held springing beneath Orient! that dost hang<br />
The space of dewdrops running over leaf;<br />
Thy fleetingness is bigger in the ghost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than Time with
all his host!</p>
<h4>X</h4>
<p class="poetry">Of thee to say behold, has said adieu:<br />
But love remembers how the sky was green,<br />
And how the grasses glimmered lightest blue;<br />
How saint-like grey took fervour: how the screen<br />
Of cloud grew violet; how thy moment came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between a blush
and flame.</p>
<h4>XI</h4>
<p class="poetry">Love saw the emissary eglantine<br />
Break wave round thy white feet above the gloom;<br />
Lay finger on thy star; thy raiment line<br />
With cherub wing and limb; wed thy soft bloom,<br />
Gold-quivering like sunrays in thistle-down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earth under
rolling brown.</p>
<h4><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>XII</h4>
<p class="poetry">They do not look through love to look on
thee,<br />
Grave heavenliness! nor know they joy of sight,<br />
Who deem the wave of rapt desire must be<br />
Its wrecking and last issue of delight.<br />
Dead seasons quicken in one petal-spot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of colour
unforgot.</p>
<h4>XIII</h4>
<p class="poetry">This way have men come out of brutishness<br />
To spell the letters of the sky and read<br />
A reflex upon earth else meaningless.<br />
With thee, O fount of the Untimed! to lead,<br />
Drink they of thee, thee eyeing, they unaged<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall on through
brave wars waged.</p>
<h4>XIV</h4>
<p class="poetry">More gardens will they win than any lost;<br />
The vile plucked out of them, the unlovely slain.<br />
Not forfeiting the beast with which they are crossed,<br />
To stature of the Gods will they attain.<br />
They shall uplift their Earth to meet her Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Themselves the
attuning chord!</p>
<h4>XV</h4>
<p class="poetry">The song had ceased; my vision with the
song.<br />
Then of those Shadows, which one made descent<br />
Beside me I knew not: but Life ere long<br />
Came on me in the public ways and bent<br />
Eyes deeper than of old: Death met I too,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And saw the dawn
glow through.</p>

265</span>MEDITATION UNDER STARS</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">What</span> links are ours
with orbs that are<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So resolutely far:<br />
The solitary asks, and they<br />
Give radiance as from a shield:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still at the death of day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The seen, the unrevealed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Implacable they shine<br />
To us who would of Life obtain<br />
An answer for the life we strain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To nourish with one sign.<br />
Nor can imagination throw<br />
The penetrative shaft: we pass<br />
The breath of thought, who would divine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If haply they may grow<br />
As Earth; have our desire to know;<br />
If life comes there to grain from grass,<br />
And flowers like ours of toil and pain;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has passion to beat bar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Win space from cleaving brain;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The mystic link attain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereby star holds on star.</p>
<p class="poetry">Those visible immortals beam<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Allurement to the dream:<br />
Ireful at human hungers brook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No question in the look.<br />
For ever virgin to our sense,<br />
Remote they wane to gaze intense:<br />
<a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>Prolong
it, and in ruthlessness they smite<br />
The beating heart behind the ball of sight:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till we conceive their heavens hoar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those lights they raise but sparkles frore,<br />
And Earth, our blood-warm Earth, a shuddering prey<br />
To that frigidity of brainless ray.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet space is given for breath
of thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond our bounds when musing: more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When to that musing love is brought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And love is asked of love&rsquo;s wherefore.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis Earth&rsquo;s, her gift; else have we
nought:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gift, her secret, here our tie.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And not with her and yonder sky?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bethink you: were it Earth alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Breeds love, would not her region be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sole delight and throne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of generous Deity?</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deeper than this ball of
sight<br />
Appeal the lustrous people of the night.<br />
Fronting yon shoreless, sown with fiery sails,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is our ravenous that quails,<br />
Flesh by its craven thirsts and fears distraught.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spirit leaps
alight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doubts not in
them is he,<br />
The binder of his sheaves, the sane, the right:<br />
Of magnitude to magnitude is wrought,<br />
To feel it large of the great life they hold:<br />
In them to come, or vaster intervolved,<br />
The issues known in us, our unsolved solved:<br />
That there with toil Life climbs the self-same Tree,<br />
Whose roots enrichment have from ripeness dropped.<br />
So may we read and little find them cold:<br />
Let it but be the lord of Mind to guide<br />
<a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>Our
eyes; no branch of Reason&rsquo;s growing lopped;<br />
Nor dreaming on a dream; but fortified<br />
By day to penetrate black midnight; see,<br />
Hear, feel, outside the senses; even that we,<br />
The specks of dust upon a mound of mould,<br />
We who reflect those rays, though low our place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To them are lastingly allied.</p>
<p class="poetry">So may we read, and little find them cold:<br
/>
Not frosty lamps illumining dead space,<br />
Not distant aliens, not senseless Powers.<br />
The fire is in them whereof we are born;<br />
The music of their motion may be ours.<br />
Spirit shall deem them beckoning Earth and voiced<br />
Sisterly to her, in her beams rejoiced.<br />
Of love, the grand impulsion, we behold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The love that lends her grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the starry fold.<br />
Then at new flood of customary morn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at her through her showers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mists, her streaming gold,<br />
A wonder edges the familiar face:<br />
She wears no more that robe of printed hours;<br />
Half strange seems Earth, and sweeter than her flowers.</p>

268</span>WOODMAN AND ECHO</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Close</span> Echo hears the
woodman&rsquo;s axe,<br />
To double on it, as in glee,<br />
With clap of hands, and little lacks<br />
Of meaning in her repartee.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For all shall fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As one has done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tree of me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of thee the tree;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And unto all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fate we wait<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reveals the wheels<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereon we run:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We tower to flower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We spread the shade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We drop for crop,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At length are laid;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are rolled in mould,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From chop and lop:<br />
And are we thick in woodland tracks,<br />
Or tempting of our stature we,<br />
The end is one, we do but wax<br />
For service over land and sea.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So, strike! the like<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall thus of us,<br />
My brawny woodman, claim the tax.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor foe thy blow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though wood be good,<br />
<a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>And
shriekingly the timber cracks:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ground we crowned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall speed the seed<br />
Of younger into swelling sacks.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For use he hews,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make awake<br />
The spirit of what stuff we be:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our earth of mirth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And tears he clears<br />
For braver, let our minds agree;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then will men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within them win<br />
An Echo clapping harmony.</p>
<h3><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>THE
WISDOM OF ELD</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">We</span> spend our lives
in learning pilotage,<br />
And grow good steersmen when the vessel&rsquo;s crank!<br />
Gap-toothed he spake, and with a tottering shank<br />
Sidled to gain the sunny bench of Age.<br />
It is the sentence which completes that stage;<br />
A testament of wisdom reading blank.<br />
The seniors of the race, on their last plank,<br />
Pass mumbling it as nature&rsquo;s final page.<br />
These, bent by such experience, are the band<br />
Who captain young enthusiasts to maintain<br />
What things we view, and Earth&rsquo;s decree withstand,<br />
Lest dreaded Change, long dammed by dull decay,<br />
Should bring the world a vessel steered by brain,<br />
And ancients musical at close of day.</p>
<h3>EARTH&rsquo;S PREFERENCE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Earth</span> loves her
young: a preference manifest:<br />
She prompts them to her fruits and flower-beds;<br />
Their beauty with her choicest interthreads,<br />
And makes her revel of their merry zest;<br />
As in our East much were it in our West,<br />
If men had risen to do the work of heads.<br />
Her gabbling grey she eyes askant, nor treads<br />
The ways they walk; by what they speak oppressed.<br />
How wrought they in their zenith?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not writ;<br
/>
Not all; yet she by one sure sign can read:<br />
Have they but held her laws and nature dear,<br />
They mouth no sentence of inverted wit.<br />
More prizes she her beasts than this high breed<br />
Wry in the shape she wastes her milk to rear.</p>
<h3><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>SOCIETY</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Historic</span> be the
survey of our kind,<br />
And how their brave Society took shape.<br />
Lion, wolf, vulture, fox, jackal and ape,<br />
The strong of limb, the keen of nose, we find,<br />
Who, with some jars in harmony, combined,<br />
Their primal instincts taming, to escape<br />
The brawl indecent, and hot passions drape.<br />
Convenience pricked conscience, that the mind.<br />
Thus entered they the field of milder beasts,<br />
Which in some sort of civil order graze,<br />
And do half-homage to the God of Laws.<br />
But are they still for their old ravenous feasts,<br />
Earth gives the edifice they build no base:<br />
They spring another flood of fangs and claws.</p>
<h3>WINTER HEAVENS</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Sharp</span> is the night,
but stars with frost alive<br />
Leap off the rim of earth across the dome.<br />
It is a night to make the heavens our home<br />
More than the nest whereto apace we strive.<br />
Lengths down our road each fir-tree seems a hive,<br />
In swarms outrushing from the golden comb.<br />
They waken waves of thoughts that burst to foam:<br />
The living throb in me, the dead revive.<br />
Yon mantle clothes us: there, past mortal breath,<br />
Life glistens on the river of the death.<br />
It folds us, flesh and dust; and have we knelt,<br />
Or never knelt, or eyed as kine the springs<br />
Of radiance, the radiance enrings:<br />
And this is the soul&rsquo;s haven to have felt.</p>

272</span>NOTES</h2>
<h3>PHAETHON<br />
<i>The Galliambic Measure</i></h3>
<p>Hermann (<i>Elementa Doctrinae Metricae</i>), after citing
lines from the Tragic poet Phrynichus and from the Comic,
observes:</p>
<p>Dixi supra, Phrynichorum versus videri puros Ionicos
esse.&nbsp; Id si verum est, Galliambi non alia re ab his
differunt, quam quod anaclasin, contractionesque et solutiones
recipiunt.&nbsp; Itaque versus Galliambicus ex duobus versibus
Anacreonteis constat, quorum secundus catalecticus est, hac
forma:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p272b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Graphic depiction of scheme"
title=
"Graphic depiction of scheme"
 src="images/p272s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The wonderful <i>Attis</i> of Catullus is the one classic
example.&nbsp; A few lines have been gathered elsewhere.&nbsp;
Lord Tennyson&rsquo;s <i>Boadicea</i> rides over many
difficulties and is a noble poem.&nbsp; Catullus makes general
use of the variant second of the above metrical forms:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Mihi januae frequentes</i>, <i>mihi limina
tepida</i>:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With stress on the emotion;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Jam</i>, <i>jam dolet quod egi</i>, <i>jam
jamque poenitet</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A perfect conquest of the measure is not possible in our
tongue.&nbsp; For the sake of an occasional success in the
velocity, sweep, volume of the line, it seems worth an effort;
and, if to some degree serviceable for narrative verse, it is one
of the exercises of a writer which readers may be invited to
share.</p>
<h3>THEODOLINDA</h3>
<p>The legend of the Iron Crown of Lombardy, formed of a nail of
the true Cross by order of the devout Queen Theodolinda, is well
known.&nbsp; In this dramatic song she is seen passing through
one of the higher temptations of the believing Christian.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
